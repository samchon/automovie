/**
 * A production's own light sources and how they move across its STORY clock.
 *
 * A shot's `lightMotions` states light over the shot's own clock, which is the
 * right unit for a light that belongs to the moment: a lamp switched on, a
 * candle blown out. It is the wrong unit for a light that belongs to the
 * production. A shot is seconds long and the light that crosses a production is
 * not; stating it per shot means every shot restages the same source, and the
 * only thing keeping two shots consistent is that whoever wrote them happened
 * to write the same numbers. Nothing then relates the light in the first shot
 * to the light in the last, so a production whose LENGTH is part of its subject
 * has no way to say so, and that is a gap no particular subject owns: an
 * expedition, a shift, a vigil, a festival, a siege, a crossing all need it and
 * need the same thing from it.
 *
 * So a production declares its sources ONCE, here, and states their motion on
 * the story clock ({@link IAutoMovieStoryClock}) rather than on any shot's. Each
 * shot then inherits the state at ITS story time, which its own
 * {@link IAutoMovieShotStoryTime} pin already fixes. The pin is the whole
 * mapping and this declaration adds no second clock of its own: two shots
 * pinned an hour apart in the story inherit an hour apart, however far apart or
 * close together the edit cuts them, and a shot that stretches story time
 * through its `rate` carries the light along at the same stretch.
 *
 * Entirely optional and purely additive. A production that declares none is
 * unaffected in every respect, and so is any shot that carries no story pin: an
 * unpinned shot asserts nothing about when it happens, so there is no moment at
 * which to read a story-clock source, and inventing one (the epoch, say) would
 * put every unpinned shot under the same light and call it a fact.
