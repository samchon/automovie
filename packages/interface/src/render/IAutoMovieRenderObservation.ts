 * This record carries measurements only. It does not choose a budget, infer a

 * the renderer cannot report that dimension for this frame; it must remain
 * unchecked instead of being approximated from scene membership.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/rendering/budgets.md#rendering-runtime-budget-enforcement Carries the current-frame observations that can be compared with a declared budget.
 * @evidence specifications/editorial-render-and-delivery/render-budget-identity-and-recovery.md#spec-render-budget-preflight Represents the observed side of the planned-versus-rendered budget audit.
