/**
 * The category of a deterministic constraint violation, aligned with the
 * engine's validator tiers.
 *
 * The kind is not cosmetic: it routes a failure to the right corrector and
 * orders cheap checks before expensive ones (principle 6, "builder tiers"). A
 * `type` failure is caught in microseconds before any `physics` check runs, and
 * a `rom` failure is fed back with anatomical context a generic type error
 * could not carry.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/diagnostics/input-and-result-classification.md#diagnostics-failed-not-run Exposes `AutoMovieViolationKind` as the portable data boundary for the diagnostics failed not run requirement.
 * @evidence specifications/validation-and-diagnostics/classification-and-causality.md#validation-failed-not-run-states Types `AutoMovieViolationKind` for the validation failed not run states system contract.
