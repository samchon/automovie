/**
 * One actor's resolved state at the end of a compiled beat.
 *
 * `transform` is the actor's world-space root with any sampled pose root folded
 * in. `pose` keeps only the final articulation; its root is cleared to avoid
 * double-applying the same displacement when a later beat uses this as its
 * starting state.
 *
 * Beyond the end pose, the state carries what a _resumable_ simulation needs so
 * the next beat continues instead of resetting: the gait cycle phase, the root
 * velocity, the planted feet, and the persistent mount coupling. Each is `null`
 * when it does not apply, so a static prop and a mid-stride walker share one
 * shape.
