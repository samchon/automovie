 * Engine query: can `actor`, from where it stands, **reach** `target`? The

 * span, stride), so the agent stages a strike/grab at a distance that
 * _connects_ instead of miming at air: the classic failure, here as a
 * deterministic precondition the agent can query before committing. A bone
 * target is sampled from its actor's resolved pose at `t`, optionally under the
 * resident beat's performed shot.
