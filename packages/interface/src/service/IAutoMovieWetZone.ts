 * One wet or waterproofed region, bound to a logical space of the served

 *
 * A shower room, a plant room with a floor gully, a fountain surround and a
 * roof terrace are the same record at different grades. The point of stating it
 * is that "there is a drain in the render" and "the water has somewhere to go"
 * are different claims: a zone names the membrane that holds the water in, how
 * far it turns up the walls, which way the floor falls, which drains it falls
 * to, and where it hands over to a drier region. Those are the facts a leak is
 * found in, and none of them are visible in a still frame.
 *
 * The zone is the architecture-facing half of the drainage graph and cites both
 * halves by stable id: boundaries come from the built environment, drains come
 * from the service network. It carries no geometry of its own, so it can never
 * disagree with either.
