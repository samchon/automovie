/**
 * Explicit triangle-mesh geometry: imported, baked, or deterministically generated.
 *
 * Unlike a {@link AutoMoviePrimitiveShape} with compact named dimensions, a
 * mesh carries explicit bulk vertex data. Ingest may decode it from a
 * glTF/VRM/FBX, an engine may bake it, or ordinary production TypeScript may
 * generate it deterministically from reviewed equations and inputs. An
 * authoring agent does not hand-transcribe opaque bulk arrays; it authors the
 * named generator and lets that program produce the data.
 *
 * Attributes follow the glTF convention of parallel flat arrays indexed by
 * vertex: `positions` is `[x0,y0,z0, x1,y1,z1, ...]`, so `positions.length` is
 * `3 * vertexCount`. `normals` and `uvs` (when present) align to the same
 * vertex order. `skin` binds vertices to skeleton bones for deformation.
 *
 * Reference: glTF 2.0 mesh primitive attributes.
