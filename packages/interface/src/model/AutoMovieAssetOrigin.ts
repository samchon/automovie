/**
 * Where a model's geometry came from: assembled by automovie, or imported by
 * the user.
 *
 * This gates the pipeline. A `generated` model is built by automovie's geometry
 * phase, typically as assembled parametric primitives
 * ({@link AutoMoviePrimitiveShape}). An `imported` model is a mesh the user
 * supplied (glTF / VRM / FBX) and the ingest package normalized; automovie then
 * only drives motion and expression on it, skipping geometry generation.
 * Recording the origin as a discriminated value keeps that branch explicit
 * rather than inferred from whether a mesh happens to be present.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/asset-authoring/external-assets.md#asset-external-gltf-scene Exposes whether a model was authored locally or adopted as an external 3D scene.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/alternatives-instances-and-groups.md#asset-spec-external-adoption-alternatives Types the explicit generated-versus-imported pipeline branch.
