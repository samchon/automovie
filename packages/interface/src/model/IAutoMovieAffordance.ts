/**
 * A semantic contact point an object declares in its **own model-local frame**,
 * where another body may rest, grab, plug, or hang, independent of any bone.
 *
 * This is the model-frame sibling of {@link IAutoMovieAttachment}: where that
 * couples a child to a **bone** of a posed skeleton (a rider on a horse), an
 * affordance marks a contact on the model itself (a crate's stackable top, a
 * mug's handle), so stacking and grabbing become authored data instead of
 * hand-tuned offsets. The engine's `resolveAffordanceSeat` aligns one model's
 * affordance frame onto another's; `affordanceSupportContacts` turns a
 * `stack-top` extent into the support contacts the topple judgment consumes.
