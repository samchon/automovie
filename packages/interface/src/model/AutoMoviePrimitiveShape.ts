/**
 * A compact parametric primitive shape.
 *
 * Where an {@link IAutoMovieMesh} carries explicit bulk vertex data, a
 * primitive is a handful of named, bounded dimensions such as "a 0.4 m sphere"
 * or "a 1.8 m tall capsule". It is the concise representation when a reviewed
 * result needs no free-form topology. More complex deterministic source may
 * generate an explicit mesh instead of pretending primitives can express it.
 *
 * Discriminated on `type`; each variant carries only the dimensions its shape
 * needs. All dimensions are in meters and expected to be strictly positive (the
 * engine rejects a zero/negative extent).
