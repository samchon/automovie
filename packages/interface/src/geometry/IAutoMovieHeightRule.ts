/**
 * How high the ground is, as a rule rather than a mesh.
 *
 * One declaration, because two records ask the question: the production world's
 * terrain, which a crowd is placed on, and the scene's standable space, which a
 * performer stands and foot-plants on. A rule spelled twice is how a member and
 * the figure beside it come to stand on two different grounds, so both cite
 * this and one engine function answers it.
 *
 * Every kind is pure arithmetic over its own stored numbers: the same rule
 * answers the same height on every machine and every run.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/map/terrain-and-landforms.md#map-elevation-slope Declares the elevation rule from which ground height and slope are deterministically derived.
 * @evidence specifications/world-and-site/terrain-ground-and-geology.md#world-site-elevation-slope-surface-input Types the supported single-valued terrain surface inputs and their sampling state.

       * `constant` is one number and `plane` is a single tilt, so neither can
       * express a rise: a hill, a terraced square, a riverbank, a stepped
       * approach. This is the smallest rule that can. The grid is a lattice of
       * stored heights and the surface height between them is interpolated, so
       * relief costs `columns * rows` numbers rather than a mesh.
       *
       * **Bounds.** The grid is a sampling lattice, not an extent: the
       * footprint still says where the surface exists, exactly as it does for
       * `constant` and `plane`. A query outside the lattice clamps to the
       * nearest edge sample rather than extrapolating, because extrapolating a
       * sampled relief invents terrain nobody authored, and a lattice that
       * covers its footprint never reaches this at all.
       *
       * **Interpolation.** Bilinear between the four surrounding samples. The
       * result is continuous across cell boundaries and reproduces a stored
       * sample exactly at its own lattice point, so a member standing on a
       * sample stands at the authored height.
       *
       * **Determinism.** Pure arithmetic over the stored samples: the same
       * design answers the same height on every machine and every run. Nothing
       * is sampled from an image, a noise function, or a seed here; a generator
       * that wants relief bakes its samples into this array, where the builder
       * digests them with the rest of the design.
