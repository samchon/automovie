/**
 * The interpolation curve used to blend from one keyframe to the next.
 *
 * Motion in automovie is **sparse keyframes + easing**, not dense per-frame
 * emission. The model places a handful of key poses and names how to glide
 * between them; the engine samples the curve at the consumer's frame rate. This
 * is what makes motion both cheap (few tokens) and temporally coherent (the
 * curve removes jitter that independent per-frame emission would introduce).
 *
 * The named curves cover the common ergonomic cases; `cubicBezier` is the
 * escape hatch for an explicit curve (control points carried on the keyframe).
 *
 * @evidence requirements/motion/clips-keyframes-and-interpolation.md#motion-interpolation Exposes `AutoMovieEasing` as the portable data boundary for the motion interpolation requirement.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/motion-sampling-and-composition.md#performance-motion-clip-keytime-interpolation Types `AutoMovieEasing` for the performance motion clip keytime interpolation system contract.
