/**
 * The binding that makes an independent fluid domain a building's water
 * feature.
 *
 * This record, not the fluid domain, is the building-owned half. The domain
 * stays a free-standing computational unit; the feature says _this building
 * unit's logical space is the basin that domain fills, and this is the rim it
 * is held by_. A production world with no building at all places the same
 * domain by simply not writing one of these.
 *
 * Nothing here re-states geometry. The basin's extent is the architecture's
 * logical space, the lattice's extent is the domain's grid, and the engine
 * checks that the binding actually resolves rather than trusting a name.
