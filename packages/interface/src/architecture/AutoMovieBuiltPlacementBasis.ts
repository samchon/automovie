/**
 * How a resolved placement quantity was measured.
 *
 * A placement answer is only as good as the extent it was taken from, so the
 * basis travels with every result. `element-geometry-bounds` measured the same
 * vertices the renderer draws. `population-placement-bounds` is the
 * conservative envelope of a compact repeated field, never its expanded
 * members. `surface-height-rule` evaluated an authored support surface exactly.
 * `element-origin-point` measured no extent at all: the building record states
 * where the body stands but carries no vertices for it, as with a runtime model
 * reference, so the box is that single stated world origin and an overlap or
 * gap taken from it is a claim about a point rather than about a volume.
 *
 * The engine assigns `element-origin-point` whenever an element's resolved box
 * has equal minimum and maximum on every axis, so a model whose drawn vertices
 * all coincide carries that label too.
