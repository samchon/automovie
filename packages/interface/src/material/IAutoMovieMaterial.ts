/**
 * A physically-based (PBR) surface material: the "what it's made of and how it
 * catches light" of a character or object surface.
 *
 * Fields mirror the glTF 2.0 metallic-roughness model so a generated material
 * maps 1:1 onto `three.js` `MeshStandardMaterial`, VRM/MToon inputs, and glTF
 * export. Every coefficient is a scalar documented to `[0, 1]` or an
 * {@link IAutoMovieColor}; the whole material is a small numeric record, which
 * is exactly why an LLM can author or tweak it ("make it more metallic",
 * "rougher", "warmer base color") through structured output; the engine
 * range-checks the coefficients.
 *
 * Texture _maps_ (image-based base color / normal / roughness) are referenced
 * by id rather than embedded: the pixel payload is an asset the engine
 * resolves, not something the LLM emits.
 *
 * Reference: glTF 2.0 `pbrMetallicRoughness`
