 *
 * The host is never mutated. The caller removes the returned faces, relocates
 * only the now-internal seam, and appends the shared bridge. Other components'

 * there before attachment. This supplies an unambiguous planar chart, not an
 * anatomical section, tangent match, or arbitrary 3D intersection certificate.
 * @evidence requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-controls-replacement Reserves connected host skin large enough for a component's proposed seam without a guessed influence radius.
