 *
 * attachmentFade and the returned cage use millimetres. Layer factories emit
 * metre-valued engine fields. The fade and its derivative are supplied to that
 * same deformation operation, so its Jacobian and emitted-triangle checks see
 * the final masked map. Convert only at that boundary, then add its displacement
 * back to the original millimetre coordinates. Zero influence remains exact.
 *
 * Every layer reads the same host; stable ID sorting fixes summation order.
 * The host has already passed topology validation. Optional layer sampling
 * inserts shared midpoints without moving the basis; omission preserves its
 * triangles. Material groups survive, and the caller recomputes normals after
 * the boundary fade, whose spatial gradient also changes the surface slope.
 * @evidence requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-controls-replacement Applies composed skin movement while preserving open attachment rims, original material groups and caller-owned coordinates.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-controls Fixes field summation by layer ID and passes the geodesic fade with its differential into the engine's final deformation checks.
