/**
 * Bind an entire dental group through the same component protocol as the eyes,
 * nose and mouth. This interior does not cut or deform skin. The mouth owns its
 * opening; the group reads the actual refined oral anchors during native
 * preparation. The compatibility finisher packs that same owned millimetre mesh.
 * Socket IDs belong to the subject, while enamel, arch and placement remain
 * independent controls. All offsets and local geometry use millimetres.
 * Observed-maxilla attachment instead captures the host before performance,
 * so a facial expression cannot translate or tilt the upper arch with a lip.
 * @evidence requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-anatomical-components Fits an upper enamel row as a non-cutting interior component using caller-owned oral bindings.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-components Defers the upper row to final oral anchors or an explicitly captured observed-maxilla frame, preserving its rigid group placement.
 * @evidence requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-expression Separates resident maxillary teeth from the moving oral aperture.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-expression Retains an observed upper-arch attachment during lip and mandibular performance.
