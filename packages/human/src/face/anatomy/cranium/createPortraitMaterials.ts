 * Provisional linear-RGB PBR finishes. These values are not sampled sRGB pixels

 * Keep IDs stable: the anatomical builders bind their parts to these names.
 * Diagnostic clay views replace finishes while keeping these same mesh buffers.
 * @evidence requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-anatomical-components Supplies stable material identities used by anatomical skin, ocular, nasal and oral parts.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-components Creates fresh untextured linear-RGB PBR records, including the shared iris palette and separate corneal-supporting tissue finishes.
