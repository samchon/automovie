/**
 * Serialize an admitted static face to GLB and glTF with resident resources.
 * The package owns both document creation and its writer: glTF-Transform uses
 * class identity internally, so passing a Document between independently loaded
 * CommonJS and ES-module copies can silently discard its geometry. Returned
 * bytes and JSON have no such module-instance identity requirement.
 *
 * This applies the same static geometry, Float32 and optical-material admission
 * as portraitDocument. It does not mutate the model, fetch resources or create
 * an animation. Consumers register the supported extensions when reading.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-export Returns the face's actual static geometry and optical materials as independently readable assets.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-export Keeps document and writer in one module instance before exposing portable GLB bytes and glTF resources.
