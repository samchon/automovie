 * breadth alone does not separate the proximal surfaces. Hidden roots are not modelled.
 *
 * Optional side contours locate each contact crest independently. Their heights
 * join the regular sampling rows, so an unsampled authored crest cannot shrink
 * the delivered crown or silently change arch spacing. The row always supplies
 * mesialDirection (+1 or -1 along local X); a standalone crown defaults to +1.
 * Incisal rise is multiplied by x^2 and fades toward the cervical end, retaining
 * a continuous central edge even when the two proximal corners differ.

 * cycle is constructed with the loft, before any row placement or packing.
