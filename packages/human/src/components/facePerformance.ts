/**
 * Attach brow elevation and mandibular skin movement to the same source host
 * as the optical and oral components. The mouth owns its entire vermilion
 * population; this component never applies a second jaw transform to that band.
 * The maxilla, eye markers and skin above the oral transition remain stationary.
 *
 * This is explicit weighted kinematics, not a simulated muscle or skull. The
 * perioral transition spans the observed central opening, with a four-mm
 * minimum for a closed observation; lower facial tissue follows the hinge.
 * Brow movement adapts neighbouring skin over twelve mm and the resident brow
 * fibres subsequently read the final shared skin instead of a detached offset.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-expression Carries brow and mandibular performance through their actual facial attachments.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-expression Keeps fixed optics and maxillary tissue separate from the moving lower face.
