 * Derive an owned, two-sided card finish from an admitted base material. Keep

 * identity and resident mask leave untextured users of the base unchanged.
 * The model owner validates base material fields and derived-id uniqueness.
 * @evidence requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-anatomical-components Gives numerical hair cards a resident fibre mask while preserving authored finish controls.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-components Separates card texture and mask handling from shared untextured finishes without changing geometry.
