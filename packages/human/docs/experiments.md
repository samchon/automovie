# Human experiments

Experiment sets run under the Human skill's [work order](../../../.agents/skills/human/SKILL.md#work-order): each set is planned in [redesign-plan.md](redesign-plan.md), run in full outside the live source, and recorded here before the plan changes.

## Head base fits before the protrusion set (f1, 2026-10-26)

Runs of `fitHeadBase.ts` made one at a time before the set below was planned; recorded as the evidence the set starts from. Keys every 6 mm from 1425 to 1699.5 mm, 128 control points, Tukey threshold 3 mm, thin-plate lengths relaxing to 5 mm. Offsets are the inliers' normal offsets to the observed rows.

| Run | Change | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | thin-plate energy on the coordinates, five head row files | inliers fell from 138,514 to 32,315 samples, median 0.70 mm: the energy counts a closed section's own curvature as bending and shrinks every section, so the samples left the rows |
| B | no fit, the initial keys only (sections smoothed to 8 cycles) | 138,514 inliers, median 0.18 mm, 90th percentile 0.80 mm |
| C | thin-plate energy on the correction from the stage's keys, five row files | killed by the system for memory |
| D | as C with the saved loft and the tilted rows only | median 0.081 mm, 90th 0.50 mm, 99th 2.16 mm; the stand-off map shows the base climbed onto the protrusions while relaxing: nose tip 4 mm, each auricle split in two regions of 8 to 9 mm |
| E | as D, protrusions detected on the 20 mm stage and masked afterwards | lips one region (5 mm); each auricle in ten fragments (5 to 14 mm); no nose-tip region: from sections smoothed to 8 cycles the 30 mm wide nose survives about half, and the 20 mm stage fits it |
| F | sections smoothed to 4 cycles, a 40 mm first stage | stopped by the compliance audit before it finished: a second constant change made and rerun one at a time |

Findings: the thin-plate energy belongs on the correction (run A); a relaxing robust fit swallows a protrusion from its edges unless the protrusion is fixed once at a scale the base cannot follow (runs D, E); that scale is set by the widest protrusion, which the protrusion set below decides.

## Protrusion detection set (planned)

See the plan's fit section; results are recorded here when the set has run.
