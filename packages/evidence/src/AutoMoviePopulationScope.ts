/**
 * Selects the exact authored population being written and reviewed.
 *
 * A first pilot narrows only a branch with a real partition selector. For a
 * film, treatments remain flat and contain only the events the pilot can
 * realize, while scripts and screenplays select one delivery group. A library
 * pilot has no invented group selector: it starts before sibling owners exist
 * and takes the first real design/source branch through review. The
 * complete-production reset is a verified transition checkpoint that selects
 * the complete population and preserves the exact reviewed construction
 * predecessor. Rebuilding begins in complete-production mode after that
 * checkpoint, with recoverable pilot history and unready descendants archived
 * outside the governed population.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/production-evidence/input.md#agent-production-evidence-visible-selection Makes complete, pilot, and post-pilot reset populations visible in the generated project's sole declaration.
 * @evidence specifications/production-evidence/input.md#spec-authoring-production-evidence-input-state Defines the closed population-scope union and its exact pilot group identity.
