 *
 * The gate is on entering review rather than on entering draft, because
 * `DESIGN_FOUNDATIONS` is not a tree. `motions` and `systems` name each other,
 * so a draft-entry rule would deadlock the pair with no legal order. Gating
 * review lets both sit in draft and evidence while they are written against one
 * another and then promote together in one declaration, which is the only
 * honest way to review a mutual dependency: each is read with the other's
 * reviewed units available.
 *

 * delivers spaces without a map branch owes no map references, and forcing one
