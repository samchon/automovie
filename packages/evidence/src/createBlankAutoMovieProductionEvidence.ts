/**
 * Create the one explicit unselected production declaration installed by a
 * fresh scaffold.
 *
 * The language remains an explicit caller input. Everything else is the
 * closed blank state: no production kind, no active branch, no local claim,
 * and the complete-production population mode that becomes effective only
 * after authorship selects a kind. The shipped scaffold passes its render
 * placeholder here; the graph admits that value only while no language pack
 * is materialized and nothing is selected, so the template evaluates without
 * a language ever being defaulted.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/production-evidence/input.md#agent-production-evidence-visible-selection Makes the initial unselected state as visible and complete as every later tracked declaration.
 * @evidence specifications/production-evidence/input.md#spec-authoring-production-evidence-input-state Produces the complete unselected declaration from which the production author explicitly activates its kind and stages.
