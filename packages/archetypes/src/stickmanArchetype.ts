/**
 * The catalogue's articulated figure: one height-driven primitive rig.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-connected-basis This primitive figure catalogue does not provide the connected anatomical face prior or its independent editing document.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-connected-basis Primitive rig construction does not compile sparse facial endpoints or separate connected facial material regions; the human authoring builder owns that operation.
 *
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/actors/facial-authoring/README.md#face-requirements The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide detailed facial authoring across document, editor and study review.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-document The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide the standalone human-face recipe, basis and version interpreter.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-anatomical-components The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide named craniofacial components, cavities and attached tissues.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-skin-condition This height-driven primitive proxy has no anatomical facial skin; rest-state and expression-driven skin morphology belongs to independently authored human faces.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-skin-colour This primitive actor has no reference facial tissue or pigmentation regions; it does not synthesize anatomical colour.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-controls-replacement The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide anatomical detail overrides and side-specific part replacement.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-expression The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide observed-relative eyelid, oral, dental and gaze performance.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-editor The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide the interactive face editor, camera and file controls.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-editor-state The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide transactional face-document history and asynchronous last-valid publication.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-export The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide validated anatomical face GLTF/GLB serialization.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-provenance The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide non-executable selected-portrait facts in the face document.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/actors/facial-authoring/contract.md#actor-face-review The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide per-person source inventories, direct render inspection and likeness decisions.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/README.md#face-specifications The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide the complete face construction, application and review boundary.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-document The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide human-face version admission and photo-independent basis interpretation.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-components The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide cranial, cervical, ocular, nasal, oral and auricular surface assembly.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-skin-condition Primitive proxy construction has no portrait attachment graph, tissue fields or locally refined skin surface to synthesize.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-skin-colour This primitive actor has no reference facial tissue or pigmentation regions; it does not synthesize anatomical colour.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-controls The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide ordered face defaults, trait offsets, array replacement and asymmetric detail.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-attachments The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide face-part cut ownership and final-surface attachment correspondence.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-expression The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide the neutral/observed/current face solve and fixed optical identity.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-editor The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide request-generation isolation and committed face history.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-editor-view The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide DOM face controls, camera/clay state and last-valid downloads.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-export The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide face-specific Float32, optical-material and GLTF serialization admission.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-provenance The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide nullable portrait provenance that does not execute during face replay.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-review The stickman catalogue constructs a coarse primitive skeleton and body; it does not provide input/output review receipts, required portrait views and subjective acceptance.
 *
 * Every proportion is derived from `height`, so one number moves the whole
 * runtime and the compiled result stays reproducible. It is one catalogue's
 * idea of an upright figure, registered like any other archetype rather than
 * known to the builder.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/actors/body-scale-and-landmarks.md#actor-proportion-neutral Derives one explicit neutral skeleton and every segment proportion from metric height inputs.

 * @evidence requirements/actors/representation-tiers-and-fidelity-boundary.md#actor-quality-claim-boundary Makes the direct representation visibly and structurally a stick proxy.

 * @evidenceExclude requirements/actors/README.md#actor-요구사항 This file supplies one crude body representation and does not implement the complete actor identity, voice, state, performance, and validation family.
