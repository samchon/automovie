/**
 * Select the authored 0.72-second HORSE_PROFILE trot. Its table uses lateral upper-limb phase pairing and 0.46 duty, so this label does not establish a measured equine trot. Seconds, metre translations and degree joint angles are authored demo data. The existing horse page consumes these clips in raw quadruped rig space: humanoid arm slots are front legs and little-finger slots are the tail.
 *
 * @evidence contracts/common.md#principled-implementation The existing literal motion AST or canonical engine profile/sequence/travel operation preserves the authored timing, skeleton identity and transform vocabulary.
 * @evidence contracts/common.md#clear-and-simple-design One named clip producer serves the existing horse selector; FK, interpolation, optional ROM clamping, GPU upload and camera behavior remain downstream.
 * @evidence contracts/common.md#prohibited-implementation-shortcuts No species measurement, clinical ROM, floor-contact admission, continuous skin or observed model health is certified by producing a motion. The stated angles/speeds are authored conventional values.
 * @evidence contracts/common.md#meaningful-documentation The comment identifies the actual units, consumer, ownership and unverified boundaries of this declaration.
 * @evidence contracts/performance.md#efficient-algorithms All four profile gaits, including rear, are generated at twenty-four samples before selecting trot.
 * @evidence contracts/performance.md#reuse-equivalent-work Fresh calls retain independently mutable motion documents rather than a hidden cross-call cache; within-clip references and canonical shared profile rows keep their existing aliasing. Consumers must not mutate module-owned profile rows.
 * @evidence contracts/performance.md#bound-retention-and-release-resources The caller owns generated clip data for its actor/page lifetime; the producer acquires no GPU handle, worker, event listener or timer and retains no caller skeleton after return.
