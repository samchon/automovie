/**
 * Where an opening's panels stand, in world space, at one named state.

 * Omitting the state answers for the state the record itself stands in, which
 * is the placement {@link lowerBuiltEnvironment} stages. Naming another one
 * answers for that state without editing the record, so a shot can ask where
 * the leaf would be when open without a second building.
 *
 * A state is a configuration rather than a moment. A door that swings on screen
 * is a shot `objectMotions` clip over the
 * {@link IAutoMovieOpeningPanelPlacement.node} ids this answers with, so the
 * architecture record never grows a second clock beside the shot's own.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/interior/scope-and-host-boundary.md#interior-current-product-scope `builtOpeningPanelPlacements` returns where an opening's panels stand, in world space, at one named state. This ensures authored building-interior state remains explicit and reviewable within its supported host boundary.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/scope-and-host.md#interior-space-building-interior-boundary `builtOpeningPanelPlacements` resolves every opening panel to its world-space placement at the requested state.
 * @evidence requirements/interior/doors-windows-and-openings.md#interior-opening-components `builtOpeningPanelPlacements` materializes the declared movable fill panels at their named-state world placements without claiming unmodeled frame or hardware components.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/boundaries-openings-and-circulation.md#interior-space-host-opening-operation `builtOpeningPanelPlacements` resolves the movable panel subset of the host opening's declared operation state.

 * carries one displacement. Validation refuses a work where two members claim
 * the same element, so the table is a merge of disjoint keys rather than a
 * race, and whichever member owns the element owns it everywhere.
 *
 * A state that names no value for a member leaves that member at rest.
 * `validateBuiltEnvironment` refuses such a record by name, and answering at
 * rest is what keeps a query over an unvalidated one from failing on a value it
