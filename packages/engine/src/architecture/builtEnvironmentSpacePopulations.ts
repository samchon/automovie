/**
 * Report the compact populations standing in a logical space and its
 * descendants.
 *
 * {@link builtEnvironmentSpaceNodes} names them; this hands back the records, so
 * a caller that needs a member's own transform regenerates it from the same set
 * the renderer draws instead of re-deriving a placement law from the geometry.
 * Selection is by declared membership, exactly as an element's is: a population
 * states the one space it occupies and every ancestor of that space folds it in,
 * so nothing here tests a member's position against a cell. That is deliberate.
 * A floor flag rests on the floor plane and an ashlar block sits inside the
 * wall, both of them on or across the boundary a derived test would have to
 * judge them against, so deriving membership would answer "the room is empty" in
 * exactly the cases the room is most full.
