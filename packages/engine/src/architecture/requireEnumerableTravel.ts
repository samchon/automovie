/**
 * Refuse a panel whose travel the swept envelope could not enumerate.
 *
 * The solver walks the critical angles the travel actually crosses, so an
 * infinite limit or a range spanning more than a full turn is not a wrong
 * answer waiting to happen: it is a walk that never reaches its end.
 * {@link validateBuiltEnvironment} refuses both by name and shares the very same
 * cap, so this only ever fires on a record that was never validated — and on
 * one of those, a named refusal is the only acceptable outcome.
  * @evidence requirements/interior/scope-and-host-boundary.md#interior-current-product-scope `validateBuiltEnvironment` validates the graph, geometry references, and spatial topology of a building. This ensures authored building-interior state remains explicit and reviewable within its supported host boundary.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/scope-and-host.md#interior-space-building-interior-boundary `validateBuiltEnvironment` performs built environment validation when the engine resolves ownership, topology, and geometry inside one building-interior boundary.
