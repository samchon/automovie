/**
 * The point one arc-length fraction reaches along a route polyline.
 *
 * Measuring by arc length rather than by point index is what keeps a landing on
 * an unevenly spaced route where its author put it, exactly as a connector
 * section is placed. Only {@link builtConnectorGeometry} calls this, and it has
 * already refused a route with no measurable length, so the segment the
 * fraction falls in always exists.
  * @evidence requirements/interior/scope-and-host-boundary.md#interior-current-product-scope `validateBuiltEnvironment` validates the graph, geometry references, and spatial topology of a building. This ensures authored building-interior state remains explicit and reviewable within its supported host boundary.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/scope-and-host.md#interior-space-building-interior-boundary `validateBuiltEnvironment` performs built environment validation when the engine resolves ownership, topology, and geometry inside one building-interior boundary.
