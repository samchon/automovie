/**
 * The axis-aligned box containing every given point.

 * Folded rather than spread through `Math.min`, because the callers are no
 * longer only the four corners of a leaf: measuring a space's contents hands
 * this every vertex the space draws, and a spread of that many arguments is a
 * stack overflow rather than a slow answer.
  * @evidence requirements/interior/scope-and-host-boundary.md#interior-current-product-scope `validateBuiltEnvironment` validates the graph, geometry references, and spatial topology of a building. This ensures authored building-interior state remains explicit and reviewable within its supported host boundary.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/scope-and-host.md#interior-space-building-interior-boundary `validateBuiltEnvironment` performs built environment validation when the engine resolves ownership, topology, and geometry inside one building-interior boundary.
