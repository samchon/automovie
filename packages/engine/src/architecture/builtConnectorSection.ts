/**
 * The usable section of one connector record, or null when it states none.
 *
 * This is the record-addressed form {@link builtConnectorSectionAt} answers
 * through. A caller already holding the record reads it here rather than
 * resolving an id a second time, because a work carrying two connectors under
 * one id would otherwise be sectioned against whichever one was declared first
 * — a contradiction validation refuses by name, and one this function has no
 * business re-deciding. The route parameter is not range-checked here; the
 * id-addressed form owns that guard.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/interior/scope-and-host-boundary.md#interior-current-product-scope `builtConnectorSection` produces the usable section of one connector record, or null when it states none. This ensures authored building-interior state remains explicit and reviewable within its supported host boundary.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/scope-and-host.md#interior-space-building-interior-boundary `builtConnectorSection` returns the usable section declared by a connector, or `null` when it has none.
