 * {@link polygonInside} and {@link polygonsOverlap} build on it, and the
 * footprint-ring placement in `space` classifies points with it. A point on an
 * edge or vertex, within `PLANAR_EPSILON` scaled by the edge's size, counts as
 * inside. The polygon is a closed ring in any winding; the answer is
