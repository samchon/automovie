/**
 * World matrices for every element, optionally displaced by panel travel.
 *
 * A joint displacement is applied after the element's own local transform and
 * therefore rides down the hierarchy, which is what makes a folding leaf work
 * without a second parenting notion: parent its element to the leaf it folds
 * against and the outer leaf's travel carries it.
  * @evidence requirements/interior/scope-and-host-boundary.md#interior-current-product-scope `validateBuiltEnvironment` validates the graph, geometry references, and spatial topology of a building. This ensures authored building-interior state remains explicit and reviewable within its supported host boundary.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/scope-and-host.md#interior-space-building-interior-boundary `validateBuiltEnvironment` performs built environment validation when the engine resolves ownership, topology, and geometry inside one building-interior boundary.
