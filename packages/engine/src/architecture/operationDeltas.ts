/**
 * The element-local displacement every moving member carries in a named state.
 *
 * The default is the environment's own current state; a caller asking for
 * another state gets that one instead, which is how a shot stages the same
 * building with its doors open without editing the record. An opening or run
 * that has no such state simply does not move, so asking for `open` swings the
 * doors that can open and leaves every other opening, and every lift, exactly
 * where it was.
 *
 * Openings and runs share one table because they share one rule: an element
 * carries one displacement. Validation refuses a work where two members claim
 * the same element, so the table is a merge of disjoint keys rather than a
 * race, and whichever member owns the element owns it everywhere.
 *
 * A state that names no value for a member leaves that member at rest.
 * `validateBuiltEnvironment` refuses such a record by name, and answering at
 * rest is what keeps a query over an unvalidated one from failing on a value it
 * was never given.
  * @evidence requirements/interior/scope-and-host-boundary.md#interior-current-product-scope `validateBuiltEnvironment` validates the graph, geometry references, and spatial topology of a building. This ensures authored building-interior state remains explicit and reviewable within its supported host boundary.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/scope-and-host.md#interior-space-building-interior-boundary `validateBuiltEnvironment` performs built environment validation when the engine resolves ownership, topology, and geometry inside one building-interior boundary.
