 *
 * @evidence requirements/asset-authoring/validation.md#asset-geometry-validation `polygonIsSimple` produces whether a closed polygon never crosses or touches itself away from a shared corner. This ensures degenerate or self-intersecting planar geometry is rejected before use.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/fidelity-and-validation.md#asset-spec-validation-numeric-structure `polygonIsSimple` performs is simple polygon calculation when the engine checks finite planar topology before consuming geometry.
