/**
 * Build the **flinch** a struck body yields under an impact: the reactive
 * `push` (a deflection driven by the impulse) propagates down a `chain` of
 * bones (from the contact bone toward the body) losing strength by `falloff`
 * each link, and **each joint only yields as far as its ROM allows**
 * ({@link IAutoMovieJointConstraint}). So what the hit _does_ to the body is
 * bounded by the same joint ranges the engine already validates against: a neck
 * can only snap so far, a spine only bend so much.
 *
 * This is the ROM-aware half of collision response: the reactive force decides
 * how hard the push is, the joint ROM decides how far the body actually goes.
 * The caller maps an {@link IAutoMovieImpact}'s impulse to the `push`
 * magnitude.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/effects-and-simulation/rigid-motion-ballistics-and-collision.md#effects-impact-consequence Applies the contact reaction without exceeding declared joint range.
 * @evidence specifications/simulation-effects-and-sound/rigid-collision-and-damage.md#collision-proxy-and-world-contact-output Produces the ROM-bounded pose consequence of world contact.
