/**
 * The ASSEMBLE consumer: fold the editor's cut-list into an
 * {@link IAutoMovieSequence} over the shots the pipeline actually built. The
 * gates are editorial physics: every entry must name a built shot, a trim must
 * select a positive span that lies inside its shot, a transition must not
 * outlast the incoming shot's played span, and the film must play at a positive
 * frame rate. Pacing and continuity stay prose. They have no cheap
 * deterministic verifier, so the schema carries the rationale instead.
 *
 * `runtime` sums each entry's played span (its trim's duration, else the whole
 * shot); transitions overlap the previous entry's tail, so each transition
 * subtracts its duration from the straight sum.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/editorial/tracks-stacks-and-composition.md#editorial-sequential-tracks Validates shot references, trims, and transitions before folding the ordered edit entries into one explicit runtime.
 * @evidence requirements/editorial/rational-time-and-ranges.md#editorial-time-ranges Keeps every played picture entry as a positive source start-and-duration span and refuses a trim that falls outside its referenced shot.
 * @evidence requirements/editorial/rational-time-and-ranges.md#editorial-time-transforms Preserves the supported unit-rate affine subset: an optional source trim followed by ordered film placement, with no claim to scale, reverse, hold, or nested transforms.
 * @evidence requirements/editorial/rational-time-and-ranges.md#editorial-frame-grid Validates one finite positive film `fps` and carries it onto the assembled sequence; it does not claim that authored edit times lie on integer frames.
 * @evidence requirements/editorial/rational-time-and-ranges.md#editorial-time-refusal Rejects non-finite rate, non-positive or overflowing trim spans, invalid shot durations, and impossible transition durations without dropping the bad entry into a partial success.
 * @evidence requirements/editorial/clips-source-ranges-and-handles.md#editorial-clip-refusal Rejects a trim with a non-finite, non-positive, or source-overflowing range and reports its exact edit-entry path.
 * @evidence requirements/editorial/scope-and-identity.md#editorial-story-film-order Uses the authored edit-entry order as film presentation order while retaining each referenced shot identity, without rewriting the shots' source order.
 * @evidence requirements/editorial/scope-and-identity.md#editorial-source-preservation Builds sequence entries from shot references plus trim and transition metadata and leaves the performed source shots unchanged.
 * @evidence requirements/editorial/scope-and-identity.md#editorial-authored-cut Copies the approved entry order, trims, and picture transitions into the sequence without optimizing pacing or film grammar.
 * @evidence requirements/editorial/scope-and-identity.md#editorial-duration-closure Closes picture runtime by summing whole or trimmed shot spans and subtracting validated transition overlaps; it makes no sound, marker, effect, or tail-duration claim.
 * @evidence requirements/editorial/scope-and-identity.md#editorial-missing-refusal Refuses an empty edit plan or an entry whose performed shot is absent instead of treating input order, filenames, or prior output as a finished timeline.
 * @evidence requirements/editorial/tracks-stacks-and-composition.md#editorial-composition-refusal Refuses duplicate source-shot identity, an empty primary picture sequence, missing references, invalid picture spans, and unsupported adjacent transition overlap before marking the sequential cut successful.
 * @evidence requirements/editorial/transitions-and-overlaps.md#editorial-transition-timing Treats each transition duration as an incoming overlap, subtracting it once from picture runtime only after both adjacent played spans can contain it.
 * @evidence requirements/editorial/transitions-and-overlaps.md#editorial-transition-boundary-samples Preserves a validated positive overlap on the incoming sequence entry, fixing its picture boundary against the previous and current played spans without claiming a blend-curve sampler.
 * @evidence requirements/editorial/transitions-and-overlaps.md#editorial-transition-refusal Rejects a first-entry, non-finite, non-positive, overlong, or mutually overlapping adjacent transition rather than silently replacing it with a hard cut.
 * @evidence requirements/editorial/validation.md#editorial-structural-validation Emits located violations for duplicate shot ids, missing references, invalid durations and trims, empty picture composition, and incompatible transition spans before returning failure.
 * @evidence specifications/editorial-render-and-delivery/rational-timeline-and-composition.md#spec-editorial-track-composition cutSequence realizes ordered output-track composition: The ASSEMBLE consumer: fold the editor's cut-list into an {@link IAutoMovieSequence} over the shots the pipeline actually built. The gates are editorial physics: every entry must name a built shot, a trim must select a positive span that lies inside its shot, a transition must not outlast the incoming shot's played span, and the film must play at a positive frame rate. Pacing and continuity stay prose. They have no cheap deterministic verifier, so the schema carries the rationale instead. `runtime` sums each entry's played span (its trim's duration, else the whole shot); transitions overlap the previous entry's tail, so each transition subtracts its duration from the straight sum.
 * @evidence specifications/editorial-render-and-delivery/rational-timeline-and-composition.md#spec-editorial-rational-timeline Validates positive source spans and film rate, preserves the unit-rate trim-plus-offset transform, and rejects invalid temporal inputs without asserting integer-frame membership.
 * @evidence specifications/editorial-render-and-delivery/rational-timeline-and-composition.md#spec-editorial-clip-boundaries Validates the supported picture trim against its source-shot duration before carrying the boundary into the cut.
 * @evidence specifications/editorial-render-and-delivery/editorial-version-conform-and-validation.md#spec-editorial-film-identity Preserves authored shot references and edit order and derives picture-plus-transition closure without claiming sound or full conform closure.
 * @evidence specifications/editorial-render-and-delivery/rational-timeline-and-composition.md#spec-editorial-transition-overlap Validates each incoming picture overlap against both adjacent played spans and retains its duration for downstream boundary evaluation.
 * @evidence specifications/editorial-render-and-delivery/editorial-version-conform-and-validation.md#spec-editorial-validation-recovery Returns stable located structural violations instead of publishing an invalid sequential picture composition as a successful cut.
