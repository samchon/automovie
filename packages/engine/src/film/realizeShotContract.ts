/**
 * Derive and validate contract outcomes from actual compiled artifacts.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/staging/shot-contracts-and-deliveries.md#staging-delivery-acceptance realizeShotContract makes delivery acceptance measurable: Derive and validate contract outcomes from actual compiled artifacts.
 * @evidence requirements/story/beats-and-causality.md#story-semantic-event-identity Joins each authored contract event id to exactly one compiled event sample and preserves that identity in the realization outcome independently of frame or shot traversal.
 * @evidence requirements/story/scenes-and-observable-action.md#story-scene-observability Evaluates only typed compiled predicates over current state, event, camera, actor, and formation facts; it does not infer an unobservable inner state from prose.
 * @evidence requirements/story/coverage-and-acceptance.md#story-falsifiable-acceptance Gives every opening, closing, event, camera, actor, and formation check an addressed subject, sample time, measured condition, and explicit failure result.
 * @evidence requirements/story/coverage-and-acceptance.md#story-acceptance-judgment-measurement Restricts automatic outcomes to structural and numeric facts from compiled artifacts and does not claim clarity, emotion, theme, or audience approval.
 * @evidence requirements/story/coverage-and-acceptance.md#story-scene-event-acceptance Separately records typed scene-boundary states, realized semantic events, and camera-required subjects instead of promoting one passing cue into whole-story acceptance.
 * @evidence requirements/production-design/visual-delivery-and-fidelity-tiers.md#production-design-blocking-pass Checks the blocking-pass structural invariants it can measure—subject identity, placement state, motion, event time, and coarse camera framing—without claiming final fidelity.
 * @evidence requirements/production-design/subject-breakdown-and-asset-plan.md#production-design-subject-prototype-instance Distinguishes compact anonymous formation slots from promoted hero actor instances when validating the compiled subject realization.
 * @evidence requirements/production-design/subject-breakdown-and-asset-plan.md#production-design-hero-background Verifies declared formation population counts and exact promoted hero nodes while leaving anonymous background members represented by compact chunks.
 * @evidence requirements/staging/shot-contracts-and-deliveries.md#staging-shot-review-times Samples the declared opening, every authored review frame, and the closing time from the compiled shot rather than inferring review instants from edit order.
 * @evidence requirements/staging/shot-contracts-and-deliveries.md#staging-shot-contract-refusal Returns addressed diagnostics when required events, actors, formations, camera subjects, or typed opening and closing predicates fail their compiled-artifact checks.
 * @evidence requirements/staging/shot-contracts-and-deliveries.md#staging-subject-deliveries Requires actor participants to have both a staged node and performance, verifies formation materialization, and tests every camera-required subject.
 * @evidence requirements/staging/visibility-and-readability.md#staging-readability-acceptance Treats a required subject as readable only when its current world box intersects the realized camera's closed frustum; it does not claim contrast, duration, reveal, or priority evaluation.
 * @evidence requirements/staging/visibility-and-readability.md#staging-visibility-time-sampling Recomputes the moving camera and each required subject bound at the opening, every declared review instant, and closing instead of reusing one visibility result.
 * @evidence requirements/camera/clipping-occlusion-and-spatial-constraints.md#camera-clipping-range Tests each required subject's current world box against the realized camera's declared near and far planes at the contract sample time.
 * @evidence requirements/camera/framing-and-shot-size.md#camera-framing-range Evaluates required subject bounds through resolved camera motion at every camera-contract sample rather than accepting one opening frame.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/staging-events-coverage-and-validation.md#performance-staging-contract-realization-acceptance-status realizeShotContract samples the compiled scene, motion, and camera facts needed to return an explicit outcome for each authored delivery predicate.
 * @evidence specifications/narrative-and-intent/events-causality-and-time.md#narrative-intent-semantic-event-occurrence Preserves authored semantic event ids while binding each one to its single current compiled occurrence and sampled predicate outcome.
 * @evidence specifications/narrative-and-intent/scene-coverage-and-acceptance.md#narrative-intent-scene-dependency-refusal Makes observable compiled state and event predicates fail when their addressed subject or sample is absent instead of accepting narrative prose.
 * @evidence specifications/narrative-and-intent/scene-coverage-and-acceptance.md#narrative-intent-story-criterion-cases Produces a mechanical pass/fail boundary for each typed contract criterion at its declared subject and time.
 * @evidence specifications/narrative-and-intent/scene-coverage-and-acceptance.md#narrative-intent-story-human-machine-verdict Keeps structural event, state, camera, actor, and formation measurements distinct from any human narrative judgment.
 * @evidence specifications/narrative-and-intent/scene-coverage-and-acceptance.md#narrative-intent-story-review-surfaces Returns one shot-contract surface of scene states, events, and camera delivery facts without claiming sequence or film acceptance.
 * @evidence specifications/narrative-and-intent/fidelity-references-and-provenance.md#narrative-intent-blocking-pass-invariants Validates only reproducible blocking structure and coarse framing facts, never photoreal finish or detailed likeness.
 * @evidence specifications/narrative-and-intent/locations-subjects-and-assets.md#narrative-intent-subject-prototype-role Preserves the distinction between compact formation slots, anonymous members, and explicitly promoted hero instances in the realization result.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/staging-space-state-and-choreography.md#performance-staging-visibility-reveal-readability Applies automatic coarse framing acceptance to current subject boxes at declared contract times; it does not evaluate occlusion, contrast, reveal, or readable duration.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/visibility-and-image-space-observation.md#clv-clipping-clearance-evaluation Applies exact current-bound frustum clipping at the addressed contract time against an empty optional plane set, because an authored camera declares no section plane and a cut view is never delivery evidence; it does not evaluate camera clearance or swept geometry.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/framing-axis-and-camera-path.md#clv-framing-interval-crop Evaluates the live subject bound at each addressed contract time; it does not claim crop intent, interval extrema, or swept visibility between samples.

/**
 * The model-space box the camera solve assumed for a required NODE subject, so

 *
 * `performShot`'s `nodeExtent` builds each `IAutoMovieFramedSubject` from the
 * same read through the same {@link nodeSubjectExtent}: a node is measured from
 * the geometry its model draws, its rig's joint span stands in when no model
 * was supplied, and a rig too small to measure takes `DEFAULT_SUBJECT_HEIGHT`.
 * Reading it back the same way is what makes the check honest. Measuring here
 * while the solve assumed a default would frame one subject and grade another.
 *
 * **The floor is part of that reading, not a detail of it.** A model's rest
 * extent is measured in MODEL space, so `min` states where the geometry starts
 * relative to the node's own origin, and it is only zero for a figure that
 * stands on its origin. The solve raises the framed base by it — a canopy whose
 * deck is authored 8 m above its element origin is framed at 8 m — so a grade
 * that placed the same span at the origin would test a segment 8 m below
 * everything the camera was aimed at. That is not a stricter check but an
 * unsatisfiable one: on the fixture `test_film_camera_node_subject_floor` pins,
 * `full`, `medium` and `close` all put the deck squarely in frame while the
 * origin-based segment fell outside it, and no camera the author could write
 * would have passed, because moving down to catch the segment moves the deck
 * out.
 *
 * **So is the width.** The same measurement states what the subject fills
 * horizontally, and the solve aims at the middle of that and stands back for
 * it, so the grade reads the same box: a 60 m facade authored outward from its
 * element origin is tested on `x 0…60, z −1…1` about its own centre rather than
 * as a pole 30 m away from it.
 *
 * A formation does not come through here. Its extent is its own transformed
 * bounds ({@link formationSubjectBox}), measured from where its members stand
 * rather than from one model's rest geometry.
