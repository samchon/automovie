/**
 * Gate the object clips a shot's source authored, so a moving thing that is not
 * a performer can reach a compiled shot at all.
 *
 * Everything on `objectMotions` used to be baked by the engine from a verb: a
 * launch's flight, a coupling's follow. Nothing else could get there, and two
 * separate contracts already promised that something would.
 * {@link builtOpeningPanelPlacements} says in as many words that a door which
 * swings on screen is an `objectMotions` clip over the panel node ids it
 * answers with, and {@link IAutoMoviePropArticulation} says a prop's hinge is a
 * lowered joint a clip drives. Both were true of the data and false of the
 * pipeline: no field carried such a clip, so every door in every production was
 * a configuration that could be authored open or shut and never seen to move.
 *
 * One channel serves both, because they are one thing: a node in the staged
 * graph, turned over the shot's own clock. A building's panel is a staged set
 * piece (`<environment>/<element>`) and a prop's leaf is a lowered articulation
 * joint (`<placement>/<joint>`), and admitting only one of them would leave the
 * other needing a second mechanism for the same sentence.
 *
 * What is refused, and why each refusal is not a preference:
 *
 * - **A node no shot staged**, or a joint no staged prop declares. A clip
 *   addressing nothing is written, validated, stored, and rendered as silence;
 *   this is the same drop the honorable-channel gate closed for pointer
 *   tracks.
 * - **A node a performance already drives.** A performer's motion comes off its
 *   rig, and a transform clip written over it would fight the pose every frame
 *   with the winner decided by producer order.
 * - **A channel a baked clip already drives**, and an id a baked clip already
 *   carries. One authority per channel, which is the grain the sampler resolves
 *   at, and `validateUniqueIds` refuses the shot outright on a duplicate id.
 * - **A key outside the shot's own clock.** A time past the end is data no frame
 *   reads, exactly as a launch landing past the end is refused rather than
 *   trimmed.
 * - **`cubicspline` interpolation.** The travel a prop declares is a bound this
 *   gate proves, and it proves it at the authored keys: between two bounded
 *   keys a `step` track never leaves the pair, and a `linear` one stays on the
 *   segment (a translation) or the arc (a rotation) between them, so neither
 *   can escape a componentwise bound its endpoints satisfy. A spline's tangents
 *   can overshoot both, and nothing downstream clamps an object clip: the
 *   viewer writes it onto the object verbatim. Refusing what cannot be bounded
 *   is the alternative to shipping a shot whose declared limit is decoration.
 *
 * The bound itself is measured rather than asserted: the clips resolve through
 * {@link resolveFrame} over the lowered graph with every staged prop's profile
 * bound at its own placement prefix, which is the same CONSTRAIN stage the
 * engine's own door round-trip is proved with. A clamp that fires is reported
 * with the profile that owns it, so a correction round reads "this travel, this
 * channel" instead of an anonymous number.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/motion/object-motion-and-interaction.md#motion-interaction-refusal Refuses unstaged targets, undeclared articulation, conflicting ownership, and travel outside the prop's authored limit.
