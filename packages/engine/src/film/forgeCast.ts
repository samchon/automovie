/**
 * The FORGE consumer: accept the stand-in rigs the forge stage built for the
 * script's `modelRef: null` cast members, and gate them on both contracts:
 *
 * The **casting contract**: exactly one entry per stand-in cast member (a
 * missing rig is an actor with no body; a rig for an imported-`modelRef` member
 * or for a stranger contradicts the script), and each entry's model `id` must
 * equal its cast `node`. That id is the join the staged scene's `modelRef ??
 * node` fallback resolves against.
 *
 * The **rig contract**: `validateModel` covers parts/materials/extents and the
 * skeleton graph (its violations are remapped onto the entry's path). Forge
 * adds only the performer-specific rule that generated stand-ins must have a
 * skeleton at all; boneless models are props, not castable actors.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/asset-authoring/validation.md#asset-rig-validation forgeCast admits generated performers only after their cast joins, model structure, skeleton, and motion-bearing rig contract all validate.
 * @evidence requirements/story/dramatic-characters-goals-and-relations.md#story-character-actor-binding Requires each forged performer model id to equal one authored cast-node binding, rejects strangers, duplicates, and imported-model members, and refuses a missing stand-in.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/fidelity-and-validation.md#asset-spec-validation-motion-transitions forgeCast realizes rig validation for motion transitions: The FORGE consumer: accept the stand-in rigs the forge stage built for the script's `modelRef: null` cast members, and gate them on both contracts: The **casting contract**: exactly one entry per stand-in cast member (a missing rig is an actor with no body; a rig for an imported-`modelRef` member or for a stranger contradicts the script), and each entry's model `id` must equal its cast `node`.

 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/actor-identity-state-and-fidelity.md#performance-actor-story-performance-state Preserves one explicit story-cast-node to forged actor-representation binding and reports missing or conflicting bindings instead of choosing a substitute.
