/**
 * The PERFORMANCE consumer, fold one beat's action calls into an
 * {@link IAutoMovieShot} through {@link compilePerformance}, gating both sides of
 * the seam: the calls must reference the staged world (a beat the script
 * planned, actors the stage placed), and the clips the synthesizer fattened
 * them into must survive `validateMotion` against each actor's skeleton. The
 * revise pass wins by construction: `revise.final ?? draft` is the list that
 * performs.
 *
 * A camera the shot compiles a move FROM is itself gated: its vertical field of
 * view must lie within (0, 180)° and its placement must be finite, the same
 * bounds staging applies, because an explicit staged set never passes through
 * staging and the framing solve divides by `tan(fovY / 2)`. Ungated, a zero
 * field of view baked an infinite distance into every keyframe and the shot
 * came back successful with a clip its own artifact validator refuses. Only the
 * elected camera and the coverage cameras are checked; an unused degenerate
 * camera never fails a shot that does not frame through it.
 *
 * Camera `frame` actions elect the live camera and author its move: the first
 * one names the shot's camera (staging aimed it already), rival `frame` calls
 * on a second camera are a violation, one take, one live camera, and the
 * elected camera's frame actions compile into `cameraMotion` through
 * {@link compileCameraMove}'s framing grammar. Frame subjects must resolve to a
 * point (node/point/group), and same-camera moves must not overlap in time. A
 * shot with no `frame` call falls back to the scene's first camera, locked off
 * (`cameraMotion: null`); a scene with no cameras at all cannot be framed and
 * fails.
 *
 * A group subject is measured as the BOX its members occupy, not as a point
 * with a figure's height: each staged member contributes its placement raised
 * by its own measured extent, and each formation the group names contributes
 * its whole transformed footprint under the cue playing at that instant. The
 * solve then fits that box both ways, so a mass wider than it is tall is framed
 * from the distance its width demands. This is the only subject that may name a
 * formation, and it must name one this shot compiled: a formation is a mass a
 * camera frames, never one body an actor can aim at, so the same group named on
 * a `lookAt`, `reach`, gesture aim or `launch` aim is refused rather than
 * silently aimed at the middle of a crowd.
 *
 * The blocking's `coverage` intents (#1187) are the plural half of that rule.
 * They never join the election; each compiles into its own alternate take on
 * `shot.coverage` through {@link compileCameraCoverage}, playing its single
 * intent across the whole beat so a render host can cut to the angle at any
 * instant. A coverage camera must be staged, must not be the elected live
 * camera or a sibling coverage camera, must state a real framing/move, and must
 * favour something that resolves to a point.
 *
 * Positional targets (`lookAt`, `reach`, a `point`/`strike` gesture aim, a
 * `launch` aim, a frame subject or focus, a coverage subject) resolve against
 * every staged placement, {@link scenePlacements}, **cameras included**: an
 * actor may be directed to look down the lens, which is ordinary film grammar
 * (#1294). That does not loosen the camera-as-actor rule, a camera still
 * performs nothing but `frame`; it only makes a camera a place one can point
 * at. A target that does not resolve names the id (or the relative kind) that
 * failed, never the discriminator of a kind that was legal all along.
 *
 * `launch` actions are compiled through {@link compileLaunch}: the projectile (a
 * staged scene node) gets its baked flight as a shot `objectMotion`, and, for a
 * node aim carrying `onHit`, the struck actor's recoil is folded into the
 * action list at the **engine-computed** contact, so it rides the same
 * synthesis and ROM gate as an authored `react`. The projectile must be staged,
 * the aim must resolve to a point, and the shot must reach the target at the
 * given speed, each an input violation otherwise. An `onHit` aim must also name
 * a staged scene NODE: a camera is a place to shoot at, but nothing recoils it,
 * and the injected react would otherwise name a camera as its actor behind the
 * back of the gate that refuses exactly that.
 *
 * `attachTo` actions are compiled through {@link compileAttach} once the parent
 * pose is known: the coupled child (a prop, not a rig) gets a shot
 * `objectMotion` that rides the parent's bone in scene space each frame. The
 * parent must be a staged, rigged node carrying the named bone, each an input
 * violation otherwise.
 *
 * Staged `mounts` (the persistent couplings staging declared, #674) descend
 * through the SAME {@link compileAttach} baker, spanning the whole shot, so a
 * rider rides every beat without re-issuing `attachTo`. An explicit `attachTo`
 * for the same child this beat overrides its mount; a mount emits no
 * grab/attach/detach/release events (it is standing scene state, not a per-shot
 * pickup). A mount onto a rig-less parent or an absent bone is a violation.
 *
 * Locomotion and gait-bearing actor motions pass through {@link plantStanceFeet}
 * before ROM and artifact validation. A first stride therefore emits the
 * world-space plant facts a later beat can resume; an existing opening plant is
 * converted into model space for the solve and back into scene world space
 * exactly once at this boundary. When staging supplies a scene space, its world
 * surface height is transformed into the actor's model frame for contact and
 * pinning; otherwise the legacy model-space y=0 plane remains. Static non-gait
 * clips keep their authored key grid. This conversion reads the unit-scale,
 * yaw-only actor transform {@link stageScene} emits; `staged` is that validated
 * stage result, not an arbitrary fabricated scene graph.
 *
 * @param props.skeleton Rig lookup for ROM validation; return null for a node
 *   that has no skeleton (its clip skips ROM).
 * @param props.hasActorContext Optional actor-registry membership lookup. It
 *   keeps a missing context distinct from a present context with no rig.
 * @param props.jointAxes Optional per-node clinical joint-axis lookup. Supply
 *   the same axes the renderer/player uses so ground planting and attachment
 *   baking read the rig through one basis.
 * @param props.restFrames Optional per-node clinical rest-frame lookup. Supply
 *   the same frame table the renderer/player uses so ground planting and
 *   `attachTo` objectMotions read the visible pose, not raw rig-space FK.
 * @evidence requirements/staging/budgets-safety-and-validation.md#staging-deterministic-replay Validates staged action references and synthesized motions before producing one deterministic performed-shot result.

 * @evidence requirements/staging/events-and-timing.md#staging-simultaneous-events Orders equal-time interaction events by an explicit semantic kind priority and then stable event id, independent of action traversal order.
 * @evidence requirements/staging/interactions-and-choreography.md#staging-choreography-phases Converts authored launch, reaction, grab, attach, detach, and release actions into timed motion plus their contact and ownership consequences.
 * @evidence requirements/staging/interactions-and-choreography.md#staging-choreography-time-sampling Places generated contact, hit, coupling, and reaction results on the same shot-local clock used to sample the motions that caused them.
 * @evidence requirements/staging/scope-and-source-of-truth.md#staging-resolved-scene-state Resolves targets from the staged scene placements and samples actor or object motion at the addressed shot time instead of mixing a nominal blocking point with a live result.
 * @evidence requirements/staging/subjects-and-object-staging.md#staging-rest-active-placement Starts each subject from its staged rest transform, then gives active actor, launch, attachment, or mounted motion explicit shot-local authority without duplicating the subject.
 * @evidence requirements/story/scenes-and-observable-action.md#story-scene-subject-dependencies Requires every performed actor, camera, frame or focus target, projectile, and attachment parent to resolve through the authored script and staged scene before compiling the shot.
 * @evidence requirements/story/scenes-and-observable-action.md#story-unfilmable-scene-refusal Returns addressed violations when required actor, camera, target, projectile, or carried-object dependencies are absent or contradictory instead of fabricating a filmable substitute.
 * @evidence requirements/camera/position-and-movement.md#camera-path-refusal Refuses invalid or non-finite camera timing and transforms, unresolved frame targets, rival live cameras, overlapping frame moves, and current-revision body or parent-rig obstruction.
 * @evidence requirements/camera/projection-lens-and-sensor.md#camera-optical-refusal Refuses non-finite or non-positive focal length and a framing camera field of view outside the finite open interval `(0, 180)`.
 * @evidence requirements/camera/scope-and-identity.md#camera-shot-distinction Elects one stable `shot.camera` identity and carries coverage cameras as separate take records instead of treating an edit or shot id as the camera.
 * @evidence requirements/camera/scope-and-identity.md#camera-authored-intent Validates and preserves the authored framing, move, focus target, and focal-length metadata without inferring dramatic intent from the resulting picture.
 * @evidence requirements/camera/scope-and-identity.md#camera-missing-refusal Refuses an absent or invalid framing camera and unresolved frame targets rather than fabricating a default camera at the world origin.
 * @evidence requirements/camera/targets-focus-and-depth-boundary.md#camera-focus-distance Resolves the authored focus target to a world point and preserves it with focal-length metadata; it does not calculate a numeric depth-of-field result.
 * @evidence requirements/camera/targets-focus-and-depth-boundary.md#camera-depth-of-field-boundary Keeps focus and focal length as declarative camera intent while FOV alone drives geometric framing, making no rendered blur claim.
 * @evidence requirements/camera/targets-focus-and-depth-boundary.md#camera-target-refusal Refuses missing or unresolvable frame, focus, and coverage targets before camera motion is compiled.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/staging-events-coverage-and-validation.md#performance-staging-deterministic-replay-failure-result performShot realizes deterministic staging replay and validation: The PERFORMANCE consumer, fold one beat's action calls into an {@link IAutoMovieShot} through {@link compilePerformance}, gating both sides of the seam: the calls must reference the staged world (a beat the script planned, actors the stage placed), and the clips the synthesizer fattened them into must survive `validateMotion` against each actor's skeleton.
