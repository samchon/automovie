/**
 * The STAGING consumer, fold the script's cast and the staging stage's
 * placements into the {@link IAutoMovieScene} every later stage performs into.
 * This is the first rung of the film pipeline: coding-agent stage payloads in,
 * a validated engine artifact or a violation list out.
 *
 * Referential integrity is the whole check: every placement must name a cast
 * member, every cast member must be placed (an unplaced character can never
 * appear on screen), ids must not collide, and a camera aimed at a node or a
 * mount riding a parent must point at something that exists. A camera's target
 * may be any staged placement, another camera included, the same table the
 * performance stage resolves its positional targets against (#1294). Geometry
 * is converted, not judged, whether 0.7 m is striking range is the reviewer's
 * business, not a constraint.
 *
 * Conversions: `facingDeg` (about +Y, 0 = facing +Z) becomes the node's
 * rotation; a set piece's optional `scale` becomes the node transform's scale
 * (one primitive at many sizes); a camera's `lookAt` resolves to a point and
 * the shortest-arc rotation aims its −Z there; a light placement lowers to the
 * scene light its `type` names (directional, point, spot, or area), aimed by
 * `direction` and placed at `position`, in its authored color.
 *
 * The environment is two halves of one thing (#1173): `set` pieces are the
 * visible geometry the guide passes draw, and the optional `space` is the
 * ground's meaning, standable surfaces and walkability, copied onto the
 * composed scene after {@link validateSpace} accepts it. Omitting `space`
 * composes `space: null`, the scalar ground plane the engine assumed before.
 *
 * A set may also declare its `fog`, the scene's atmosphere and the depth cue an
 * exterior otherwise has no way to state: it is range-checked here and lowered
 * verbatim. Omitting it composes a scene with no `fog` at all, which renders
 * exactly as every staged scene did before atmospheres existed.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/staging/budgets-safety-and-validation.md#staging-deterministic-replay Resolves the screenplay's sets, performers, cameras, lights, and mounts or returns every deterministic contradiction.
 * @evidence requirements/staging/budgets-safety-and-validation.md#staging-spatial-validation Checks finite placement geometry and exact cast, node, camera-target, and mount-parent relations before composing the scene.
 * @evidence requirements/staging/scope-and-source-of-truth.md#staging-resolved-scene-state Lowers accepted rest transforms, camera aims, typed lights, ground, and environment into one explicit initial scene state.
 * @evidence requirements/staging/subjects-and-object-staging.md#staging-rest-active-placement Emits actors and set pieces at their authored rest transforms with no active motion or pose, while retaining declared mount bindings beside the scene.
 * @evidence requirements/staging/subjects-and-object-staging.md#staging-placement-refusal Refuses missing cast or target identities, duplicate scene ids, dangling mounts, and non-finite placement transforms instead of inventing replacements.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/sources-and-photometry.md#lighting-source-distribution Lowers the supported directional, point, spot, and rectangular-area subset with its kind-specific direction, position, range, cone, extent, and authored color.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/sources-and-photometry.md#lighting-source-refusal Rejects invalid intensity, missing or zero direction, forbidden position or range, invalid cone, and missing or non-positive panel extent before lowering a source.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/color-exposure-and-display-boundary.md#lighting-color-refusal Rejects a staged light color when its linear components are non-finite or outside the unit interval.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/shadows-reflections-and-transmission.md#lighting-shadow-identity Validates the staged source's cast flag, map size, bias, normal bias, and near/far interval, and refuses an unsupported area-light shadow map.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/staging-events-coverage-and-validation.md#performance-staging-deterministic-replay-failure-result stageScene produces the same resolved scene or addressed failure for the same script and staging inputs.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/staging-space-state-and-choreography.md#performance-staging-mark-surface-zone-membership Composes accepted rest placements into a resolved scene state without fabricating missing identities or transforms.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/staging-space-state-and-choreography.md#performance-staging-interaction-choreography-role Separates static rest-node placement from persistent mount bindings and refuses unresolved, duplicate, or non-finite placement relations.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/light-source-photometry-and-environment.md#clv-source-distribution-color Carries only the engine's supported source kinds, orientation, falloff, cone, panel extent, and linear color into scene light state.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/light-source-photometry-and-environment.md#clv-source-sampling-refusal Validates the static staged sample's intensity, direction, range, cone, and extent and rejects unsupported field combinations before scene creation.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/light-transport-color-and-budget.md#clv-color-comparison-refusal Enforces the finite unit-range numeric domain of authored linear light components without claiming a display conversion.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/light-transport-color-and-budget.md#clv-shadow-state-sampling Carries one fixed source's validated cast flag and explicit shadow-map sampling settings into the scene light.

 * had to hand-patch `scene.lights` after `stage` and lose the referential

 * {@link IAutoMovieLight} models, which makes each kind's parameter set exact
 * rather than advisory:
 *
 * - An aimed light (`directional`, `spot`, `area`) needs a finite non-zero
 *   `direction` and a `point` light must not carry one, since it radiates every
 *   way;
 * - A positioned light (`point`, `spot`, `area`) needs a finite `position` and a
 *   `directional` light must not carry one, since it is infinitely distant;
 * - `range` belongs to the two punctual falloff kinds, `coneAngle` to `spot`
 *   alone, and `width`/`height` to `area` alone.
 *
 * A parameter that cannot act is refused rather than ignored: silently dropping
 * a `coneAngle` on a point light is the same false green the campaign is
 * closing elsewhere. Colors are range-checked here too, because `stage` is the
 * only rung between the model and the scene.
