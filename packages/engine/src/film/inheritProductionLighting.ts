/**
 * One shot's lights at one shot-local instant, with the production's sources
 * inherited at the story moment the shot's pin places that instant at.
 *
 * The staged lights come back UNCHANGED, element by element, whenever there is
 * nothing to inherit: no production lighting, or a shot carrying no story pin.
 * That is the additivity promise made whole — a film that says nothing about
 * production light renders precisely the frames it rendered before this pass
 * existed, and an unpinned shot is not quietly assigned a story moment it never
 * claimed.
 *
 * The merge is by ID and its order is fixed:
 *
 * - A staged light whose id a production source shares is REPLACED, in place. The
 *   production owns that source; the scene declaring it says which of the
 *   production's lights this scene stands under, and the values it declares are
 *   the ones the production overrides. That is precisely "inherit rather than
 *   restage".
 * - A production source no staged light names is APPENDED, in declaration order,
 *   so a film states its source once instead of every scene re-declaring it.
 *
 * Appending moves one downstream index and it is worth naming: the viewer adds
 * lights as top-level scene children between the nodes and the space group, and
 * the segmentation mask palette is keyed by top-level child index. Node colours
 * are unaffected (they precede every light), while the space group's colour
 * shifts by the number of appended sources. It remains a pure function of the
 * artifacts, which is the property the palette actually needs; a mask consumer
 * comparing two productions was never comparing colours across scenes anyway.
 *
 * This composes with, rather than replaces, a shot's own `lightMotions`: hand
 * the result to the applier that plays those clips and the shot's local
 * statement (a lamp switched on inside this beat) lands on top of the inherited
 * state (the light the production is under at this moment). Both are the same
 * pointer grammar over the same table, so the composition needs no rules of its
 * own.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/scope-and-identity.md#lighting-branch-identity inheritProductionLighting overlays shot-local sources on story-time production sources while preserving each light's branch identity.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/temporal-state-and-continuity.md#lighting-state-time-sampling inheritProductionLighting maps the requested shot-local second through the authored story pin before resolving inherited lights.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/temporal-state-and-continuity.md#lighting-story-continuity inheritProductionLighting replaces matching staged lights by stable id and appends unmatched production sources in declaration order.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/light-source-photometry-and-environment.md#clv-light-authority-branches inheritProductionLighting carries only explicitly inheritable production-lighting state into a child branch while preserving branch identity.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/temporal-state-and-continuity.md#clv-light-cue-observation inheritProductionLighting derives the production sample from the shot's explicit story-clock mapping.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/temporal-state-and-continuity.md#clv-edit-presentation-light-boundary inheritProductionLighting preserves stable source identity across a shot boundary by replacing the staged placeholder that carries the same id.
