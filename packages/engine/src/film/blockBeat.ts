/**
 * The BLOCKING consumer: gate one beat's shot plan before any performance is
 * compiled from it. The checks are coherence, not craft: the beat must be one
 * the script planned, every intent must belong to a placed actor, the camera
 * must favour something placed (an actor, a set piece, or another camera, the
 * same table `performShot` resolves against), and the timing anchors must sit
 * on the beat's own timeline **in the order they are listed**. The list order
 * is the causal order ("the loose before the hit"), so an anchor whose `t` runs
 * backwards contradicts the causality it exists to fix. The optional `coverage`
 * cameras (#1187) are gated the same way, plus their own rules: each must name
 * a staged camera exactly once and state a real framing/move.
 *
 * When the prior beat's end-state is supplied it becomes this beat's initial
 * condition: its actors are gated for referential integrity (every carried
 * actor must be a staged scene node, exactly once) and the validated state is
 * surfaced on the success so downstream stages resume from it rather than
 * resetting the world at the cut.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/staging/marks-zones-and-blocking.md#staging-blocking-relations Validates beat identity, staged subjects, camera targets, causal timing, and prior boundary state before performance compilation.
 * @evidence requirements/staging/scope-and-source-of-truth.md#staging-authored-blocking Returns the submitted actor, camera, coverage, and ordered-anchor plan unchanged only after its explicit relations pass the blocking gates.
 * @evidence requirements/staging/scope-and-source-of-truth.md#staging-upstream-source-trace Resolves `blocking.beat` against `script.beats` and every actor, camera, coverage target, and carried actor against identities in the staged scene.
 * @evidence requirements/story/scenes-and-observable-action.md#story-scene-subject-dependencies Resolves the beat's actor intents, hero and coverage camera targets, and carried actor states against the concrete subjects already placed in the scene.
 * @evidence requirements/story/scenes-and-observable-action.md#story-unfilmable-scene-refusal Refuses a beat whose actor, camera, coverage, or carried-state dependency is absent or duplicated instead of substituting a placeholder subject.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/staging-space-state-and-choreography.md#performance-staging-mark-surface-zone-membership Gates authored beat relations against the script and resolved placement tables before admitting the blocking to performance.
 * @evidence specifications/narrative-and-intent/scene-coverage-and-acceptance.md#narrative-intent-scene-dependency-refusal Reports unresolved concrete actor and camera dependencies before the beat can become a filmable performance plan.
