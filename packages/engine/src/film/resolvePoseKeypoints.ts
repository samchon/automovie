 * Project one posed actor's named joints to 2D screen keypoints (#1168), the
 * exact OpenPose-style conditioning automovie can emit because it already knows
 * every bone's exact 3D world position. Forward kinematics resolves the pose in
 * rig space, the staged scene node's transform lifts each bone into scene-world
 * (the same TRS the renderer composes), and the shot's camera projects it to a
 * normalized `[0, 1]` frame coordinate.
 *
 * A joint behind the camera or outside the frame is still projected (never
 * silently clamped: a clamped point reads as a false edge keypoint) but flagged
 * `inFrame: false`. Deterministic: pure FK + stateless projection.
