/**
 * Compose the `launch` verb's engine primitives into one result, the missing
 * orchestrator that turns the model's thin _"loose the arrow at him"_ into the
 * projectile's motion **and** the struck target's reaction, timed to the
 * engine-computed hit rather than a number the model had to guess.
 *
 * It {@link solveBallisticLaunch solves the aim} that connects `origin` to
 * `target` at `action.speed`, {@link projectileTrajectory bakes the flight} into
 * the projectile node's clip, and, when the launch carries an `onHit`, emits
 * the target's `react` at the detected contact time. This is the reactive event
 * the schema promises ("knock him off the ledge" without hand-timing the fall):
 * the contact time is a computed output, so the reaction is scheduled, not
 * authored. Returns `null` when the target is out of range at that speed
 * (nothing to fly, nothing to hit).
 *
 * `target` is the target's world point resolved by the caller. Pass `targetAt`
 * as well to **lead a moving target**. The aim then solves against where the
 * mover _will be_ (via {@link solveMovingLaunch}) rather than its start point,
 * and `target` is only the fallback origin of the sightline. Feed the returned
 * `clip` to the projectile node and fold `react` into the target's action list
 * before the performance compiles.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/effects-and-simulation/rigid-motion-ballistics-and-collision.md#effects-authored-simulated-trajectory compileLaunch turns the authored launch intent into an analytic flight and schedules the reaction at the engine-computed contact time.
 * @evidence requirements/actors/performance-and-story-binding.md#actor-performance-events-contacts Connects the launch actor, projectile contact, target hit, and optional reaction to the same computed shot-local impact instant.
 * @evidence requirements/staging/interactions-and-choreography.md#staging-choreography-phases Connects the launch action to its computed contact and hit phase, then emits the optional recoil or fall as the reaction consequence at that same instant.
 * @evidence specifications/simulation-effects-and-sound/rigid-collision-and-damage.md#rigid-trajectory-tier-contract Solves and bakes the authored launch while keeping the engine-computed contact time authoritative for downstream reaction.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/actor-identity-state-and-fidelity.md#performance-actor-story-performance-state Returns the realized impact event and target reaction on the performance clock beside the projectile motion.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/staging-space-state-and-choreography.md#performance-staging-interaction-choreography-role Realizes action, impact, and reaction as ordered records with stable projectile and target identities and explicit hit consequences.
