/**
 * Bake the `attachTo` verb into the **child object's** flight-follow clip, the
 * per-frame realisation of a rigid coupling to a parent's bone (a sword in a
 * hand, a prop on a saddle). The child is not a rig, so (like a projectile) it
 * moves by a node clip of transform tracks, not a pose motion.
 *
 * Each sample resolves the parent's posed skeleton at that instant
 * ({@link resolveAttachment}, which runs the parent's FK) to find the bone's
 * frame in the parent's **model space**, then composes that onto the parent's
 * **staged world placement**, or, when the parent itself rides a coupling this
 * shot, onto its per-sample ridden frame (`parentTransformAt`, #1140), so the
 * child lands in scene space:
 *
 * - `translation = parentPos + parentRot · boneLocal.translation`
 * - `rotation = parentRot ∘ boneLocal.rotation`
 *
 * So as the parent walks, turns, or swings the limb, the child rides with it,
 * position and orientation together, what a physics fixed-joint does. Pass the
 * same `jointAxes` the renderer poses the parent with (`HUMANOID_JOINT_AXES`),
 * plus the same `restFrames` when parent clips are authored in clinical space,
 * or the child follows a bone that sits where the renderer does not draw it.
 * When the parent has no motion, it holds its rest pose and the child is
 * static.
 *
 * The clip is **shot-local** (times over `[start, start + duration]`, spanning
 * `shotDuration`), the same convention as `cameraMotion` and a launch's flight:
 * before the coupling begins it holds the bone's start frame, after it the
 * last.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/motion/object-motion-and-interaction.md#motion-coupled-objects compileAttach materializes a declared parent-bone coupling as child transform tracks, keeping the object synchronized without treating it as a rigged performer.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/kinematics-contact-and-interaction.md#performance-interaction-attachment-object-handoff compileAttach realizes declared attachment and object handoff: Bake the `attachTo` verb into the **child object's** flight-follow clip, the per-frame realisation of a rigid coupling to a parent's bone (a sword in a hand, a prop on a saddle).
