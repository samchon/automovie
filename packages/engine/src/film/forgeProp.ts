/**
 * The FORGE consumer's object side, accept a prop an agent authored as data
 * (crude primitive proxy, rich meaning: body, affordances, self-declared
 * articulation, D011) and gate it on both contracts. `forgeCast` forges the
 * performers; this forges the things they hold, open, and stack.
 *
 * The **model contract**: the prop's `model.id` must equal `node` (the staged
 * scene joins on it, exactly as a forged cast member does), `origin` must be
 * `"generated"` unless the spec names the registration its imported bytes came
 * from ({@link gateImportedAppearance}), and `skeleton` must be `null`, a
 * riggable actor goes through `forgeCast`; a prop's moving parts are
 * articulation nodes, not bones. `validateModel` covers parts/materials/extents
 * plus the body (#595) and affordance (#604) semantics, remapped onto the
 * spec's path.
 *
 * The **articulation contract** (when present): joint node ids unique and
 * non-empty, parents resolving within the declared nodes (`null` = the prop's
 * root) without a cycle; each joint's optional `mesh` naming one part of this
 * prop's own model, and no part claimed by two joints; the binding targeting
 * the declared profile; every `boneMap` value naming a declared node; and every
 * semantic key the profile references ({@link profileSemanticKeys}) mapped,
 * reported **all at once**, where `bindProfile` itself would throw on the
 * first, so one correction round sees the whole list. A spec that passes these
 * gates binds without a throw; the door round-trip test drives the forged
 * artifact through `resolveFrame` to prove the declared limit clamps and the
 * declared driver drives.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/asset-authoring/validation.md#asset-purpose-validation forgeProp admits an authored prop only when its geometry, affordances, and articulation satisfy the object's declared staging purpose.
 * @evidence requirements/asset-authoring/external-assets.md#asset-external-gltf-scene Accepts only a builder-sealed rigid glTF appearance profile for an imported prop while preserving its model and LOD records.
 * @evidence requirements/asset-authoring/external-assets.md#asset-external-provenance-digest Requires every imported asset and LOD reference to carry a well-formed sealed content digest and one explicit model registration.
 * @evidence requirements/asset-authoring/external-assets.md#asset-external-resource-closure Verifies that every imported LOD asset is present in the sealed asset ledger with the same digest and profile.
 * @evidence requirements/asset-authoring/external-assets.md#asset-semantic-enrichment Keeps imported appearance separate from the project-authored affordances, articulation, binding, and purpose semantics validated beside it.
 * @evidence requirements/asset-authoring/validation.md#asset-external-generated-validation Applies the same geometry and purpose validation after distinguishing builder-sealed imported appearance from generated model input.
 * @evidence requirements/asset-authoring/rig-and-state.md#asset-general-joint-relations Validates unique articulation nodes, resolvable acyclic parents, unambiguous mesh ownership, and complete profile mappings for a skeleton-less prop.
 * @evidence requirements/external-inputs/adoption-modes-and-composition.md#external-adoption-direct-placement Preserves a registered imported prop's sealed model, asset, and LOD closure while adding only its project-owned prop semantics and placement identity.
 * @evidence requirements/external-inputs/identity-coordinates-and-units.md#external-identity-elements-dependencies Keeps the adopted model id and every sealed asset and LOD dependency attached to the forged prop gate.
 * @evidence requirements/external-inputs/unsupported-and-degradation.md#external-unsupported-hard-failure Withholds an imported prop whose registered appearance closure or project-native semantic structure is invalid instead of substituting a placeholder.
 * @evidence requirements/external-inputs/unsupported-and-degradation.md#external-fidelity-semantic-boundary Validates geometry appearance separately from affordance, articulation, profile, and physical-purpose semantics.
 * @evidence requirements/external-inputs/validation-and-quarantine.md#external-validation-structure-semantics Applies the imported model gate before the distinct prop articulation and declared-purpose semantic gates.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/fidelity-and-validation.md#asset-spec-validation-purpose-inputs forgeProp realizes purpose-driven prop validation: The FORGE consumer's object side, accept a prop an agent authored as data (crude primitive proxy, rich meaning: body, affordances, self-declared articulation, D011) and gate it on both contracts. `forgeCast` forges the performers; this forges the things they hold, open, and stack. The **model contract**: the prop's `model.id` must equal `node` (the staged scene joins on it, exactly as a forged cast member does), `origin` must be `"generated"` unless the spec names the registration its imported bytes came from ({@link gateImportedAppearance}), and `skeleton` must be `null`, a riggable actor goes through `forgeCast`; a prop's moving parts are articulation nodes, not bones. `validateModel` covers parts/materials/extents plus the body (#595) and affordance (#604) semantics, remapped onto the spec's path.

 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/alternatives-instances-and-groups.md#asset-spec-external-adoption-alternatives Admits the supported rigid glTF direct-placement subset while refusing humanoid profiles and leaving native conversion or group composition to their owners.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/identity-resources-and-lifecycle.md#asset-spec-adoption-output Preserves the accepted model reference, import profile, asset digests, and LOD closure in the returned prop record; it does not claim to create the builder's full adoption receipt.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/model-geometry-and-surface-facts.md#asset-spec-surface-resource-closure Checks the sealed path-to-digest ledger and every LOD dependency before the imported appearance can pass the prop gate.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/identity-resources-and-lifecycle.md#asset-spec-element-consumer-links Joins imported appearance identity to the exact project-authored prop node and keeps its added articulation and affordance semantics distinct.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/rig-deformation-and-state.md#asset-spec-joint-control-invariants Enforces the prop articulation hierarchy, mesh ownership, binding target, and semantic control-map invariants used by downstream motion.
 * @evidence specifications/interchange-and-adoption/adoption-decisions-and-composition.md#interchange-direct-placement-boundary Admits the registered appearance closure without relabeling it as project-native prop semantics.
 * @evidence specifications/interchange-and-adoption/identity-coordinates-and-units.md#interchange-element-dependency-identity Preserves the imported model identity and sealed asset and LOD dependencies consumed by the prop.
 * @evidence specifications/interchange-and-adoption/support-degradation-and-refusal.md#interchange-hard-refusal-predicate Returns the located gate violations and no forged prop when the sealed imported closure or required semantic structure fails.
 * @evidence specifications/interchange-and-adoption/support-degradation-and-refusal.md#interchange-appearance-semantics-fence Prevents accepted imported appearance from implying valid articulation, affordance, collision, or authored-purpose semantics.
 * @evidence specifications/interchange-and-adoption/validation-and-quarantine.md#interchange-layered-validation Separates imported model closure validation from prop hierarchy, binding, affordance, and purpose validation.

 * {@link IAutoMovieNode}, so it can name the piece of the prop that rides it,
 * and that reference is the whole of how a declared joint becomes a part that
 * visibly moves: without it a hinge turns an empty frame while the leaf stands
 * still, which is a shot that validates clean and shows nothing. The reference
 * resolves inside this prop's own model, because a prop's moving part is a part
 * of the prop; two joints may not claim the same part, since a part rides one
