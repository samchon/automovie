 * Lower one service network to the models and staged pieces that draw it.
 *
 * A run is authored as a centre line and a radius, which is the description a
 * clash and a sleeve are measured against; drawing it is the deterministic
 * derivation of that description and nothing more. Sweeping a regular section
 * along the authored line is therefore the whole of it: no fitting library, no
 * elbow catalogue, no per-discipline appearance. A production that wants a
 * modelled valve body authors that prop and places it on the node, exactly as
 * it would author any other asset.
 *
 * The geometry is baked in world coordinates, matching how a connector's route
 * and a support surface are already authored, so the staged piece carries no
 * rotation and no scale of its own and a run cannot drift from the line the
 * validator measured.
 *
 * Refuses to draw an invalid network. Lowering a graph with a dangling port or
 * a clash would put a picture of a working installation in front of the reason
 * it does not work, which is the one thing this record exists to prevent.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/interior/services-and-environment.md#interior-service-routing `lowerServiceNetwork` turns each validated service centre line and radius into the deterministic swept geometry that makes the routed installation visible.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/services-wet-and-fluid.md#interior-space-service-network-contract `lowerServiceNetwork` refuses invalid networks before emitting one world-space model and stage piece for every declared run.
