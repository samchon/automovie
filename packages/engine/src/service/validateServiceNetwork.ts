/**
 * Validate the distribution graph of a built environment: its structure, its
 * media, its geometry, and the space it needs to stay serviceable.
 *
 * A scene can be furnished with taps, sprinkler heads, diffusers and outlets
 * and still be a set: nothing in a frame distinguishes a basin joined to a
 * stack from a basin joined to nothing. This is the tier that tells them apart,
 * and it is deliberately structural rather than quantitative. It answers
 * whether the graph is whole — every port carrying a run, every node reached
 * from its system's root, every medium and unit repeated consistently, every
 * run leaving an emitter and arriving at a consumer, every fitting and the
 * ports it offers standing in the room it claims, every wall crossing declared,
 * and nothing occupying another discipline's cubic metre or an engineer's
 * access space. It does not answer head loss, voltage drop or duct pressure;
 * `serviceAnalysisSupport` names those as `unsupported` rather than letting a
 * clean result imply they passed.
 *
 * The network is checked **against** an environment rather than nested inside
 * one. Every architectural name it repeats — a logical space, an element, a
 * boundary, an opening — is resolved here, which is the one place the two
 * records meet and therefore the only place they can be shown to agree.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/interior/services-and-environment.md#interior-service-routing `validateServiceNetwork` proves that authored runs connect compatible ports, stay in their spaces, declare crossings, avoid clashes, and preserve maintenance access.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/services-wet-and-fluid.md#interior-space-service-network-contract `validateServiceNetwork` resolves every system, node, port, segment, sleeve, and architectural reference into deterministic path-addressed violations.
 * @evidence requirements/interior/services-and-environment.md#interior-service-network-validation `validateServiceNetwork` reports unresolved or dangling ports, system, medium, unit, direction and section mismatches, off-port routes, missing sleeves, clashes, and maintenance obstruction at stable paths.
 * @evidence requirements/interior/services-and-environment.md#interior-service-exterior-interface `validateServiceNetwork` resolves each stable service port and boundary penetration against the actual built-environment host without claiming ownership of an exterior map network.
 * @evidence requirements/building-exterior/services-and-envelope-interfaces.md#building-service-envelope-penetration `validateServiceNetwork` checks the real boundary or opening host, sleeve radius and route intersection, face-local containment, waterproof seal, and maintenance clearance for an envelope penetration.
 * @evidence specifications/building-envelope/services-water-weather-and-site.md#building-envelope-service-penetration-equipment-invariant `validateServiceNetwork` enforces the geometric sleeve, host, seal, route, and access subset of the service-penetration invariant without claiming flashing, fire, or thermal analysis.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/services-wet-and-fluid.md#interior-space-service-interface-boundary `validateServiceNetwork` implements the stable port, compatible medium/unit/direction, route endpoint, built-space crossing, and boundary-penetration subset of the interior interface.
 * @evidence requirements/building-exterior/services-and-envelope-interfaces.md#building-service-interior-interface `validateServiceNetwork` resolves stable service nodes, ports, route endpoints, logical spaces, boundary crossings, and penetrations in the cited built environment.
 * @evidence specifications/building-envelope/services-water-weather-and-site.md#building-envelope-service-input-output The validator implements building-side port, route, space, connectivity, and penetration checks without claiming an exterior map utility network.
