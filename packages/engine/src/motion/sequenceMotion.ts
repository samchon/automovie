/**
 * Concatenate several clips end-to-end into one timeline, the smallest step
 * toward a _performance_ (a shot stitched from beats: walk, then leap, then
 * sit). Each part's keyframes are shifted by the running offset so part `n`
 * starts where part `n−1` ended; the boundary keyframe (a later part's `time:
 * 0`) is dropped so the merged times stay strictly increasing, leaving the
 * engine to interpolate across the seam.
 *
 * The result is an ordinary {@link IAutoMovieMotion} the player samples like any
 * other (so a sequence can itself be sequenced). All parts must target the same
 * skeleton; the first part's skeleton id is used.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/motion/layers-blends-and-transitions.md#motion-layer-event-composition Makes each clip's terminal state the next clip's composition boundary.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/motion-sampling-and-composition.md#performance-motion-layer-mask-transition-composition Resolves an ordered set of non-overlapping action layers into one clip timeline.
