/**
 * Synthesise the **locomote** action: carry a looping gait clip across a
 * `distance` at `speed` in a `direction`. The engine sizes the travel: it picks
 * how many gait cycles cover the distance at the requested speed, then bakes
 * the effective velocity that ARRIVES at exactly `distance` over those whole
 * cycles (`travelMotion`), so the harness `locomote` verb ("walk to the door")
 * reaches the door instead of stopping a half-stride short. At least one cycle
 * always plays; a distance shorter than half a stride compresses that cycle so
 * the effective speed never falls below half the requested speed (#1065): a
 * quick short step instead of unbounded slow motion.
 *
 * `faceTravel` turns the body to face where it is going: the root is oriented
 * so the model's forward (`+Z`) points down the travel direction, so a figure
 * sent sideways walks facing its path instead of strafing. Omit it (the
 * default) to keep the rest facing: a strafe or a backpedal.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/motion/procedural-motion-and-gaits.md#motion-gait-table Repeats the selected gait by whole cycles while preserving its declared phase law.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/kinematics-contact-and-interaction.md#performance-kinematics-procedural-gait-rule Turns the selected gait into a finite clip that arrives at the requested destination.
