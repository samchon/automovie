/**
 * Synthesise the **react** action into a short flinch clip: snap from rest into
 * the impact's recoil and ease back. The flinch pose is the engine's
 * `impactRecoil` (the reactive `push` propagated down the bone `chain` and
 * **clamped to each joint's ROM**), so this is the harness `react` verb turned
 * into motion by the impact engine (the caller maps an `IAutoMovieImpact`'s
 * impulse to the `push`).
 *
 * A three-keyframe clip: rest (0) → flinch (`peak`) → rest (`duration`).
 * Resting axes stay `null`, the pose model's neutral representation, so a rig
 * whose ROM excludes numeric 0 does not receive invented articulation at either
 * edge.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/motion/procedural-motion-and-gaits.md#motion-general-procedural-control Converts an impact-derived recoil into a bounded, ROM-safe flinch and recovery clip.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/kinematics-contact-and-interaction.md#performance-kinematics-procedural-gait-rule Applies a deterministic compact procedural rule to the requested reaction.
