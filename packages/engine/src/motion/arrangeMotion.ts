/**
 * Lay several timed clips onto **one actor's** shot timeline, holding the last
 * pose across any gap between them: the composer the harness PERFORMANCE stage
 * uses to turn an actor's ordered action calls (each synthesised to a clip by
 * the engine) into a single performance {@link IAutoMovieMotion}.
 *
 * Each placement's keyframes are shifted to its `start`; where a gap precedes
 * the next placement, the previous clip's final pose is repeated at the next
 * start so the actor holds rather than slowly morphing across the gap. Keyframe
 * times are kept strictly increasing (an overlapping or coincident later frame
 * is dropped: v1 sequences rather than layers concurrent actions). The result
 * is a plain non-looping clip sampled like any other.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/motion/layers-blends-and-transitions.md#motion-layer-event-composition Composes ordered actions and carries the preceding terminal pose through timeline gaps.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/motion-sampling-and-composition.md#performance-motion-layer-mask-transition-composition Makes the last accepted keyframe the authoritative boundary state of the composite.
