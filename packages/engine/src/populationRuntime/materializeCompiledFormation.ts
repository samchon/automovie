/**
 * Compile one formation design into its compact, regenerable runtime record.
 *
 * The record stores what regenerates the members rather than the members: the
 * layout, anchor, heading and seed, one bounds and centroid per chunk of
 * {@link AUTOMOVIE_FORMATION_CHUNK_SIZE} slots with that chunk's anonymous
 * count once heroes are excluded, each hero's promoted base transform, the
 * anonymous representation tiers, a conservative member radius, a
 * domain-separated motion phase seed, and a digest of every other field.
 *
 * The terrain it snapshots is the part of the world that can be under a member:
 * the surfaces whose ground-plan extent reaches the footprint measured on level
 * ground, in declared order. Relief moves members up and down, never sideways,
 * so that footprint holds on any terrain, and a unit with nothing under it
 * reuses the level pass as its finished summary.
 *
 * Member radii come from the host as a table, because what measures a recipe,
 * a registered archetype or an adopted external proxy, is the host's
 * composition rather than this kernel's. The digest is SHA-256 over canonical
 * JSON v2 computed without a Node built-in, equal to the Node builder's digest
 * of the same canonical bytes.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/formations/scope-and-identity.md#formation-authoring-mode-selection Compiles a compact prototype-and-layout formation into a record whose resolved members stay reviewable without an explicit roster.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/formation-identity-layout-and-terrain.md#performance-formation-compact-representation-compatibility Preserves layout, seed, bounded chunks, hero exceptions, and the terrain snapshot instead of storing anonymous member nodes.
 * @evidence requirements/formations/heroes-variation-and-state.md#formation-hero-overrides Keeps each promoted hero at its slot's grounded base transform inside the unit while removing it from the anonymous count.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/formation-identity-layout-and-terrain.md#performance-formation-hero-variation-group-state Excludes each promoted slot from its chunk's anonymous batch exactly once and records its inherited base transform.
 * @evidence requirements/product/prototype-quality.md#product-authored-variation-determinism Rebuilds the same compiled formation, including its seeded motion phase law, from the same design, recipes, radii, and terrain.
 * @evidence specifications/authoring-and-authority/prototype-determinism-and-fidelity.md#spec-authoring-deterministic-input-identity Digests the canonical record so identical declared inputs and seed yield the identical runtime identity.
