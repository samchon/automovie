/**
 * The compiled tiers and conservative member radius of one population prototype.
 *
 * A formation's anonymous members and each prototype of an instance set are
 * drawn the same way: through the recipe's declared tiers, or through one `near`
 * tier of the base recipe when it declares none, each bound to its recipe
 * digest and runtime model id. The member radius is the largest radius over
 * those tiers, where a tier whose recipe has no known radius borrows the base
 * recipe's, and one with neither is half a metre; no member is ever smaller
 * than a centimetre for projection.
 *
 * Radii are supplied by the host. The archetype catalogue that measures a
 * generated recipe and the adopted proxy that measures an external model are
 * the host's composition, so this reads a table and never a registry.
 *
 * The caller chooses which declared tiers apply: a formation's anonymous batch
 * drops the `hero` tier, which is drawn by named nodes, while an instance set
 * has no heroes and keeps every tier. Shared by both kernels; package-private.
