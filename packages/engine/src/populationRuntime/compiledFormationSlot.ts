/**
 * Regenerate one exact member of a compiled formation in constant memory.
 *
 * The compiled record is what a viewer draws and what a shot source is handed,
 * so a member is regenerated from it rather than from the design beside it. It
 * carries the terrain snapshot the builder placed the unit on, which a design
 * record does not: a member asked of the design stands at its anchor's height,
 * and the same member drawn from the compiled record stands on the rise under
 * it. The only thing the record spells differently from a design is a hero,
 * which is a promoted slot rather than an override.
 *
 * The identity law is not restated here. This and {@link formationSlot} for a
 * grounded design both hand the slot's actor and position to
 * {@link formationSlotRecord}, which names the hero actor or the slot-derived
 * node and carries the base recipe, the designed heading and the seeded motion
 * phase. A test pins the two answers equal for every slot of a compiled
 * formation.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/formations/budgets-and-validation.md#formation-determinism Returns the same member identity, grounded transform and motion phase for a slot whichever consumer regenerates it from the compiled record.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/formation-motion-resolution-and-budgets.md#performance-formation-determinism-status-compatibility Makes a one-member regeneration return exactly the transform and state the full compiled runtime holds for that slot.
 * @evidence requirements/formations/scope-and-identity.md#formation-authoring-mode-selection Resolves one reviewable member, hero or anonymous, from a compact formation without expanding its roster.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/formation-identity-layout-and-terrain.md#performance-formation-compact-representation-compatibility Regenerates members through the shared slot generator and the compiled terrain snapshot instead of a consumer's own layout arithmetic.
