/**
 * Compile one world instance set into its compact runtime without expanding it.
 *
 * The record keeps the placement and variation laws, the route snapshot a
 * route layout follows, one bounds and centroid per chunk of
 * {@link AUTOMOVIE_INSTANCE_CHUNK_SIZE} slots, the representation tiers and
 * conservative radius of the base recipe and of every declared prototype, and
 * a digest of every other field. A declared prototype table is compiled with
 * the base recipe's default first, which is the choice list every member is
 * regenerated against afterwards.
 *
 * Bounds are measured by regenerating each slot through {@link instanceSlot},
 * so a member whose seeded variation is non-finite, or whose route is missing
 * or has no length, refuses compilation instead of producing a set no consumer
 * can regenerate. Member radii come from the host as a table, as they do for a
 * formation. The digest is SHA-256 over canonical JSON v2 computed without a
 * Node built-in, equal to the Node builder's digest of the same canonical
 * bytes.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/asset-authoring/identity-and-instances.md#asset-compression-individuality Stores a large set as laws, seed, and bounded chunk summaries from which each member's identity is still regenerated.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/alternatives-instances-and-groups.md#asset-spec-group-individuality Compresses the population by count, index, seed, and prototype while keeping one conservative radius over every selectable prototype.
 * @evidence requirements/asset-authoring/identity-and-instances.md#asset-prototype-instance Compiles the reusable prototypes, the base recipe's default included once, apart from the occurrences that select them.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/alternatives-instances-and-groups.md#asset-spec-prototype-instance Records each prototype's tiers and radius as the shared definition every slot occurrence refers to.
 * @evidence requirements/product/prototype-quality.md#product-authored-variation-determinism Rebuilds the same compiled set, including its seeded variation law, from the same design, routes, recipes, and radii.
 * @evidence specifications/authoring-and-authority/prototype-determinism-and-fidelity.md#spec-authoring-deterministic-input-identity Digests the canonical record so identical declared inputs and seed yield the identical runtime identity.
