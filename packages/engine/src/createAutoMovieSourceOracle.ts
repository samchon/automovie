/**
 * Build the deterministic helpers a shot source reads through its build context.
 *
 * A shot source asks where one member of a formation or instance set stands
 * while the builder is still compiling the shot, so the answer has to be the
 * one the compiled runtime holds. Both slot helpers regenerate from the
 * compiled records the source's context carries, never from the designs beside
 * them: a formation member stands on the terrain snapshot its unit was compiled
 * against, and an instance member selects from the compiled prototype table,
 * which already counts the default once. Distance is Euclidean in metres, and
 * ground height is the first world surface under the point or zero over none.
 *
 * An id with no compiled record refuses with a range error naming it, including
 * an id that only an inherited object property would otherwise answer.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/formations/budgets-and-validation.md#formation-determinism Answers a shot source's one-member formation and instance questions with the identity and transform the compiled runtime regenerates for that slot.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/formation-motion-resolution-and-budgets.md#performance-formation-determinism-status-compatibility Keeps the source-facing member oracle and the full compiled runtime on one regeneration path, so they return the same transform and state.
