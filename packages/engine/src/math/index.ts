// Last on purpose. This module is the only one here that imports across a
// package boundary, and inserting it ahead of `Quaternion` made
// `Quaternion.fromAxisAngle` undefined inside `stickmanArchetype` while the
// barrel was still evaluating. Order is load-bearing until that import is
// erased, so a new sibling goes above this line rather than below it.
