/**
 * The exact closest pair of points on segments `a→b` and `c→d`, the clamped
 * segment-segment solver (Ericson, _Real-Time Collision Detection_ §5.1.9),
 * minimising `|P1(s) − P2(t)|` over `s, t ∈ [0, 1]`.
 *
 * The predecessor took the smallest of the four endpoint-to-segment distances,
 * which is only an upper bound on the true distance: two segments crossing
 * through each other's **interior** (an X, the commonest self-intersection: an
 * arm sweeping through a torso) report each endpoint a full segment-width away
 * while the real distance is zero, so the forced self-intersection check (and
 * the body-collision warning) missed the overlap entirely. This solves for the
 * interior-closest parameters directly.
 *
 * Degenerate inputs stay total (the #685 discipline): a zero-length segment
 * collapses to its start via the `A/E ≤ ε` point branches, and parallel
 * segments (`denom = 0`) pin `s = 0` and clamp `t`, so no division ever hits a
 * zero denominator.
