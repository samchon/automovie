/**
 * One scalar component of glTF cubic Hermite interpolation.
 *
 * `outTangent` belongs to the left key and `inTangent` to the right; both are
 * derivatives per second, so the segment `span` scales them before the Hermite
 * basis is applied. The sampler and every range proof share this evaluator: a
 * validator proving a different polynomial than playback uses is no proof.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/motion/clips-keyframes-and-interpolation.md#motion-interpolation Evaluates the declared cubic key values and time-scaled tangents used by playback and validation.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/motion-sampling-and-composition.md#performance-motion-clip-keytime-interpolation Evaluates the declared cubic key values and time-scaled tangents used by playback and validation.
