/**
 * The lower index of the segment straddling `time` in a strictly increasing
 * sequence of `length` key times read through `timeAt`: the `lo` in `[0,
 * length
 *
 * - 2]`with`timeAt(lo) <= time <= timeAt(lo + 1)`, resolving an exact hit on an
 *   interior key to the segment ENDING at it (so `time === timeAt(k)`yields`lo
 *   === k - 1`). That tie rule reproduces the historical front-to-back linear
 *   scan the pose and track samplers used, so swapping this binary search in
 *   leaves every interpolated result byte-identical.
 *
 * Runs in `O(log length)`. The caller must already have handled the ends (`time
 * <= timeAt(0)` and `time >= timeAt(length - 1)`); this searches the strict
 * interior `timeAt(0) < time < timeAt(length - 1)`, where `length >= 2` and the
 * answer is in `[0, length - 2]`.
 *
 * The accessor form (rather than a `readonly number[]`) lets the pose sampler
 * search keyframes without materializing a times array on the hot path.
