/**
 * Integrate a fluid domain to one **absolute** step of its fixed clock.
 *
 * ## The equations
 *
 * The domain is a shallow-water field on an Arakawa C grid: water depth `h` at
 * cell centres over a bed elevation `b`, and horizontal velocity on the faces
 * between cells. Writing the free surface as `η = b + h`, one step advances
 *
 * ```text
 *   ∂u/∂t = −g·∂η/∂x − k·u                  (x momentum, on x faces)
 *   ∂v/∂t = −g·∂η/∂z − k·v                  (z momentum, on z faces)
 *   ∂h/∂t = −∂(h·u)/∂x − ∂(h·v)/∂z + q      (continuity, at cell centres)
 * ```
 *
 * With `k` the linear drag and `q` the declared source/drain volume rate per
 * unit area. Momentum is linearized — advection `u·∂u/∂x` is deliberately
 * absent — which is the bounded first tier this project committed to: a
 * gravity-wave solver for basins, channels, jets and ledges, not a
 * Navier-Stokes CFD and not a breaking-wave research code.
 *
 * Continuity is solved in **flux form** with a first-order upwind depth: the
 * volume crossing a face is `u · h_donor · dz · dt`, taken from whichever cell
 * the velocity points away from. Every interior face appears once with each
 * sign, so the only ways the total volume can change are a declared source, a
 * declared drain, and an `open` edge — which is exactly the mass-balance
 * contract this domain promises.
 *
 * ## Why it stays well behaved
 *
 * - **Lake at rest is exact.** The pressure term reads the free surface `η`, not
 *   the depth, so a still pond over an uneven bed produces a numerically exact
 *   zero gradient: velocities stay at zero and depths never drift, however many
 *   steps are integrated.
 * - **Depth never goes negative.** After the fluxes are known, each cell's total
 *   outgoing volume — faces plus drain — is compared with the water it actually
 *   holds and, if it exceeds it, every one of that cell's outgoing fluxes is
 *   scaled by the same factor. A face has exactly one donor, so scaling by the
 *   donor's factor leaves the shared face single-valued and mass still exactly
 *   conserved.
 * - **Dry land is not climbed.** A face against a dry cell carries no flow unless
 *   the wet side's free surface actually stands above the dry side's ground.
 * - **A wall reflects.** A `wall` edge, and every face touching a solid cell,
 *   pins the velocity to zero: the reflecting boundary condition.
 * - **An open edge spills.** An `open` edge behaves as a permanently dry
 *   neighbour at the boundary cell's own bed height, so water pours off the
 *   rim, never seeps back in, and the volume that left is counted.
 *
 * ## Stability
 *
 * The explicit scheme is stable while the Courant number of the gravity wave `c
 * = √(g·H)` stays at or below one:
 *
 * ```text
 *   dt · √(g · referenceDepth) · √(1/dx² + 1/dz²) ≤ 1
 * ```
 *
 * That is what {@link fluidCourantNumber} returns and what
 * {@link validateFluidDomain} refuses to exceed.
 *
 * ## Determinism
 *
 * The state is a pure function of `(domain, step)`. Nothing is cached between
 * calls, so seeking backwards, forwards, or in scattered order returns exactly
 * the same numbers as playing straight through — there is no runtime object for
 * an accumulation to hide in. Only `+ − × ÷` and `Math.sqrt` are used, all of
 * which IEEE-754 specifies exactly, so a domain whose authored numbers are
 * binary-exact reproduces bit for bit on Windows and POSIX alike.
 *
 * The domain is assumed to have passed {@link validateFluidDomain}: that pass is
 * where an array of the wrong length, a depth past the design depth, a source
 * pouring into solid matter, or an unstable step are refused with a path, so
 * the integrator never has to guess what an inconsistent record meant.
 *
 * Throws when `step` is not an integer in `[0, solver.maxSteps]`, and when the
 * state leaves the reals — a non-finite bed or depth, or a genuinely runaway
 * solve, is named at the step it first appeared rather than quietly turning
 * into NaN frames a renderer would draw as nothing at all.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/effects-and-simulation/fluids-and-water.md#effects-fluid-seek-state Reconstructs the requested absolute step from declared initial state.
 * @evidence requirements/effects-and-simulation/fluids-and-water.md#effects-fluid-volume-boundary Advances declared sources, drains, walls, open edges, and retained cell volume in physical volume units.
 * @evidence requirements/effects-and-simulation/fluids-and-water.md#effects-fluid-conservation-account Returns retained volume beside cumulative source, drain, and open-boundary outflow for the same solve.
 * @evidence specifications/simulation-effects-and-sound/fluids-water-and-world-coupling.md#fluid-surface-and-flow-tier Implements the bounded flux-form surface state and its explicit volume-change account.
 * @evidence specifications/simulation-effects-and-sound/fluids-water-and-world-coupling.md#fluid-seek-and-checkpoint-state Produces the same bounded state for repeated and out-of-order seeks.
 * @evidence requirements/interior/water-and-fluid-features.md#interior-fluid-volume-level `simulateFluidDomain` computes bounded cell depths, retained volume, sources, drains, and open-boundary outflow for the requested deterministic step.
 * @evidence requirements/map/rivers-and-inland-water.md#map-water-boundary-volume `simulateFluidDomain` advances the declared basin walls and open edges while accounting retained, sourced, drained, and escaped water volume in the same solve.
 * @evidence requirements/map/rivers-and-inland-water.md#map-water-flow The flux-form step derives directional neighbour flow from declared bed elevation and depth instead of substituting a static water surface.
 * @evidence requirements/map/rivers-and-inland-water.md#map-flood-inundation The returned cell depths and retained-volume state expose which bounded cells are inundated at the requested absolute step.
 * @evidence specifications/world-and-site/hydrology-coast-and-groundwater.md#world-site-watershed-water-boundary-input The solver consumes explicit lattice, wall, open-edge, source, and drain boundaries and preserves their volume contribution in its result ledger.
 * @evidence specifications/world-and-site/hydrology-coast-and-groundwater.md#world-site-water-flow-season-event The deterministic absolute-step solve materializes the declared source and drain event state as directional cell flux and depth.
 * @evidence specifications/world-and-site/hydrology-coast-and-groundwater.md#world-site-flood-inundation-output The state returns bounded per-cell water depth plus the volume account needed to inspect inundation without claiming a broader watershed model.
