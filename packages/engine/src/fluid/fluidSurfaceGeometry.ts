/**
 * Derive the drawable free surface of one solved fluid state.
 *
 * The engine owns this so the renderer stays a projection of the solve. A
 * viewer that built its own water mesh would be a second opinion about where
 * the water is, and a second opinion can disagree with the depth field that the
 * mass balance was proven against.
 *
 * One vertex per cell, at the cell centre, at world height `origin.y + bed +
 * depth`; vertex order is the row-major cell order, so a vertex index and a
 * cell index are the same number. A quad is triangulated only when all four of
 * its corner cells are wet (`depth > solver.dryDepth`) and none is solid, which
 * is what makes a drained basin draw nothing at all rather than a flat sheet
 * lying on its floor. Triangles wind counter-clockwise seen from above, so the
 * surface faces `+y`.
 *
 * Normals come from the central difference of the free surface, `n = normalize(
 * −∂η/∂x, 1, −∂η/∂z )`, degenerating to forward and backward differences at the
 * lattice edge and to exactly `(0, 1, 0)` on a single-cell axis: still water is
 * numerically exactly flat, which is the visual counterpart of the solver's
 * lake-at-rest property.
 *
 * {@link IAutoMovieFluidSurface.flow} is the cell-centred average of the four
 * surrounding face velocities. A renderer scrolls ripples along it and never
 * re-derives it.
 *
 * Throws when the state was not solved from this domain. Two water features
 * over two lattices is the ordinary case, so handing the second one's state to
 * the first one's grid is the ordinary mistake, and a lattice reading depths
 * that were never indexed for it emits `NaN` positions a renderer draws as
 * nothing at all — a silent empty pond in place of a named refusal.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/effects-and-simulation/fluids-and-water.md#effects-fluid-surface-flow-tier Derives the declared bounded fluid tier's drawable surface and flow field.
 * @evidence specifications/simulation-effects-and-sound/fluids-water-and-world-coupling.md#fluid-surface-and-flow-tier Projects one solved shallow-water state without a second renderer-side solve.
