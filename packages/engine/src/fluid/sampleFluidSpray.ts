/**
 * Sample the decorative spray of a fluid domain at one solved state.
 *
 * Spray is the garnish, not the water: a jet's mist and the curtain at the foot
 * of a water wall read as motion without ever entering or leaving the conserved
 * depth field, which is why the mass balance stays a statement about the solver
 * alone.
 *
 * A particle's whole life is a function of the emitter seed and its spawn
 * index, so seeking to a time reproduces exactly the set that playing straight
 * through would have shown. Particle `i` is launched at `i / rate` seconds from
 * the free surface above the emitter's cell, then follows the ballistic arc `p
 * = p₀ + d·speed·age − ½·g·age²·ŷ` for `lifetime` seconds.
 *
 * The live set is bounded twice. Distance thins it deterministically by keeping
 * every `1 + floor(cameraDistance / lodDistance)`-th index, so a fountain seen
 * from across a courtyard costs a fraction of the same fountain seen from its
 * rim, and the hard `maxParticles` cap then keeps the newest survivors. Both
 * are enforced here rather than trusted to the renderer, so the CPU reference
 * and any GPU projection agree on how many particles exist.
 *
 * Throws when the state was not solved from this domain — the nozzle stands at
 * the free surface, so a foreign state puts every jet at a depth that lattice
 * never had — and when the camera distance is not a real number, which would
 * otherwise thin the live set to nothing and read as a fountain that stopped.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/interior/water-and-fluid-features.md#interior-fluid-flow-spray Projects the declared flow as a bounded spray population.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/services-wet-and-fluid.md#interior-space-water-feature-fluid-domain Produces the spray output of an independently declared water-feature domain.
