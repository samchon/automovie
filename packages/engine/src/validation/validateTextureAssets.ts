/**
 * Close the loop between what a compiled production SAMPLES and what its asset
 * ledger AUTHORIZES.
 *
 * Four different lies are possible once materials name images, and the manifest
 * alone catches none of them:
 *
 * 1. A material binds an image the ledger never heard of, so nothing verifies its
 *    bytes or consumer bindings;
 * 2. The ledger authorizes an image for a model or shot that no longer binds it,
 *    so a stale entry keeps a file in the distributable forever;
 * 3. The bytes are not the image they are used as: a renamed `.png` that is really
 *    a PDF, or a Radiance HDR bound as a base-color map;
 * 4. Two consumers bind the same bytes under contradictory color-space intent, so
 *    the same pixels are both a colour and a measurement and one of the two is
 *    silently wrong. A material slot states its intent; a scene environment
 *    takes it from its proven media, because an equirectangular image is always
 *    a colour and only its container says how that colour is stored.
 *
 * Byte identity itself is NOT rechecked here. The manifest gate already digests
 * every registered asset against its resident bytes, and repeating that would
 * be a second copy of a rule with an owner. What this adds is the reason that
 * gate applies at all: an image nobody registered is an image nobody digests.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/asset-authoring/validation.md#asset-surface-validation Verifies every sampled texture is registered with matching image facts and intent.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/model-geometry-and-surface-facts.md#asset-spec-model-output-failures Rejects missing, unused, mismatched, and multiply interpreted surface resources before model output is accepted.
 * @evidence requirements/external-inputs/identity-coordinates-and-units.md#external-identity-value-interpretation `validateTextureAssets` keeps sRGB color slots, linear measurement slots, and Radiance environment intent explicit and rejects one image used under contradictory interpretations.
 * @evidence specifications/interchange-and-adoption/identity-coordinates-and-units.md#interchange-value-interpretation-layer The texture gate validates the Engine's image color-space and channel-role subset without claiming general raster, audio, no-data, or scalar-unit interpretation.
 * @evidence requirements/external-inputs/resource-closure-and-acquisition.md#external-resource-media-dependencies `validateTextureAssets` resolves every sampled material or environment image through its typed asset-ledger use and byte-proven image facts and rejects missing or stale uses.
 * @evidence specifications/interchange-and-adoption/resource-closure-and-acquisition.md#interchange-media-dependency-extraction The validator closes the Engine's material-texture and scene-environment dependency subset; archive, stream, sidecar, and network closure remain upstream.
 * @evidence requirements/external-inputs/unsupported-and-degradation.md#external-unsupported-format-feature `validateTextureAssets` distinguishes a readable image container from suitability for a material or environment consumer and rejects the unsupported image/material combination.
 * @evidence specifications/interchange-and-adoption/support-degradation-and-refusal.md#interchange-format-feature-support-matrix The texture gate evaluates byte-proven container type against the selected Engine consumer's accepted image subset instead of treating parser recognition as universal support.
 * @evidence requirements/external-inputs/identity-coordinates-and-units.md#external-identity-collision-ambiguity `validateTextureAssets` rejects a shared image whose material and environment bindings demand competing color-space interpretations rather than selecting one by traversal order.
 * @evidence specifications/interchange-and-adoption/identity-coordinates-and-units.md#interchange-identity-ambiguity-refusal The validator reports every conflicting binding path and blocks the ambiguous image interpretation without choosing a silent winner.
 * @evidence requirements/asset-authoring/materials-and-textures.md#asset-user-authored-texture `validateTextureAssets` accepts project-registered image resources through explicit material texture bindings and validates the exact consumers that sample them.
 * @evidence requirements/asset-authoring/materials-and-textures.md#asset-texture-provenance `validateTextureAssets` requires every sampled texture to resolve through the production asset ledger and rejects stale or missing consumer-use records.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/fidelity-and-validation.md#asset-spec-validation-surface-visual The validator implements the material-slot, channel-intent, color-space, media-type, and byte-observed extent subset of surface validation without claiming frame review.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/identity-resources-and-lifecycle.md#asset-spec-model-resource-separation Material records retain independent texture resource identities, and the validator checks those bindings without collapsing image bytes into model identity.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/identity-resources-and-lifecycle.md#asset-spec-element-consumer-links The validator derives model-material and scene-environment consumer paths and checks each against its exact ledger authorization.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/model-geometry-and-surface-facts.md#asset-spec-surface-resource-closure The validator closes every sampled texture through ledger ownership, declared use, byte-proven image facts, and compatible interpretation.
