/**
 * Measure whether a surface and the material bound to it agree about scale.
 *
 * A material record alone cannot answer this and never could. `transform.scale`
 * is turns of an image per unit of a coordinate source, so the physical size it
 * implies is a fact about the SURFACE, and until a binding declared its
 * {@link IAutoMovieTextureReference.coordinateSource} the unit that scale was
 * expressed in was not stated anywhere either. Both halves now exist at one
 * place — a part carries the mesh, the part names the material — which is the
 * only place in the pipeline where the question is answerable at all.
 *
 * Two things become decidable there, and this validator deliberately treats
 * them as different kinds of finding.
 *
 * A binding that declares `"normalized"` against a set whose measured span
 * EXCEEDS one is refused. That is not an aesthetic judgement: "normalized"
 * means the set covers the whole surface exactly once, so a span of nine is the
 * declaration contradicting the geometry it was bound to, and every downstream
 * repeat count computed from it is arithmetic on a unit that does not exist. A
 * span under one is left alone, because a set may legitimately occupy part of
 * its range.
 *
 * A `"surface-metres"` binding whose implied tile (`1 / scale`) is LARGER than
 * the surface's own span is warned about instead. The surface cannot show one
 * whole turn of the image, so a nail-sized crop of a wood grain stretches
 * across a bed post and reads as flat paint — which is exactly how it failed
 * once nothing measured it. It stays a warning because that same geometry is
 * how a single image is legitimately fitted to one face, and the engine cannot
 * read the intent from the numbers. A binding whose sampler clamps that axis
 * HAS stated the intent, so it is not warned about.
 *
 * Out of scope on purpose: `"source-uv"` sets, whose unit has no general
 * formula; bindings that omit `coordinateSource`, which make no claim to check;
 * primitive geometry, whose texture coordinates are produced downstream rather
 * than carried; a degenerate span, which is mesh topology's finding, not this
 * one; and a part naming a material the model does not define, which model
 * validation already reports.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/asset-authoring/validation.md#asset-surface-validation `validateTextureScale` detects a texture coordinate and real-scale conflict between a surface and the material bound to it instead of leaving the pairing unchecked.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/fidelity-and-validation.md#asset-spec-validation-surface-visual The validator implements the texture scale and coordinate-set subset of surface validation by measuring the bound mesh's own span, without claiming seam, state, or frame review.
 * @evidence requirements/asset-authoring/materials-and-textures.md#asset-texture-coordinates-scale `validateTextureScale` holds a declared coordinate system and real scale to the surface it is applied to, so the same declaration places the same way.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/model-geometry-and-surface-facts.md#asset-spec-material-texture-relations The validator checks the binding record's coordinate set and coordinate transform against the surface it joins without letting an image decide the material's scale.
 * @evidence specifications/asset-and-representation/model-geometry-and-surface-facts.md#asset-spec-surface-coordinate-convention The validator is what holds a declared coordinate source to the surface it was bound to, so the convention is a checked contract rather than prose beside a type.
