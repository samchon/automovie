 *
 * Checks: non-empty space/surface ids, unique surface ids, a known surface
 * kind, an outer footprint ring of at least three points with finite plan
 * coordinates (polygon `y` is documented-ignored and not checked) that encloses
 * area and does not cross itself, holes that each do the same and lie strictly
 * inside the outer ring and apart from one another, exactly one statement of
 * the surface's ground and its own rules (finite height anchors and a
 * non-degenerate ramp axis for the two-anchor spelling; finite parameters and
 * an exactly-sized lattice for a declared height rule), and walkable ids that
 * resolve uniquely to declared surfaces. Everything is `error` severity: a
 * malformed space is broken input, not an artistic choice.
 *
 * **Concave and holed footprints are accepted, and the order that happened in
 * matters.** This validator used to demand a convex footprint, and it was right
 * to: the ground query classified against the convex hull, so a notch was
 * filled and an atrium void was floored, quietly, in the query feet and props
 * read. `surfaceContains` classifies against the authored rings now (#1868), so
 * what is refused here is what that query still cannot answer — a ring with no
 * inside, or holes that do not describe a region — rather than a shape it can.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/diagnostics/identity-path-and-context.md#diagnostics-path-and-scope `validateSpace` locates malformed surface ids, rings, height rules, anchors, holes, and spacing at their exact space member paths.
 * @evidence specifications/validation-and-diagnostics/diagnostic-identity-location-and-severity.md#validation-diagnostic-path-scope `validateSpace` preserves surface identity, ring position, observed coordinate, and expected structural relation for every staging-space finding.
 * @evidence requirements/interior/floors-and-raised-floors.md#interior-floor-contact-scope `validateSpace` checks the support surface identities, walkable state, footprint rings, holes, and height rules used by contact queries.
 * @evidence requirements/interior/floors-and-raised-floors.md#interior-floor-level-slope `validateSpace` validates constant, plane, and sampled height fields that state finished support elevation and local slope.
 * @evidence requirements/interior/floors-and-raised-floors.md#interior-floor-openings-edges `validateSpace` preserves authored footprint holes and rejects rings that cannot describe a valid support region.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/surface-assemblies.md#interior-space-floor-raised-floor-contract The validator implements the finished support-surface, footprint-hole, walkability, elevation, and local-slope subset without claiming slab or raised-floor assembly depth.
