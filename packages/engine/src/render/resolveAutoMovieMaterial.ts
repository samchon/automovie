/**
 * Resolve one cross-model material id to one complete material definition.
 *
 * A model part resolves its material inside its own model. Simulated surfaces
 * carry only an id, so their lookup population is every compiled model instead.
 * Repeating an identical record under the same stable id is one definition;
 * repeating that id with any structural difference is an ambiguity and is
 * refused. Candidate and property order cannot affect either the result or the
 * diagnostic.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/rendering/materials-lighting-and-color.md#rendering-material-resolution Resolves each named simulated surface to one stable declared material identity and refuses missing or ambiguous bindings instead of selecting a fallback.
 * @evidence requirements/rendering/budgets.md#rendering-geometry-memory-budget Resolves each simulated drawable's material to one definition before its material and texture cost is counted.
 * @evidence specifications/editorial-render-and-delivery/render-products-visibility-and-color.md#spec-render-material-color Defines the deterministic cross-model identity join used before runtime material lowering.
 * @evidence specifications/editorial-render-and-delivery/render-budget-identity-and-recovery.md#spec-render-budget-preflight Defines the deterministic material-identity join used by conservative render preflight.
