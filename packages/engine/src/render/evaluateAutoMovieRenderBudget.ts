/**
 * Check one inventory against one declared budget and produce the bounded
 * report.
 *
 * The report answers for every metric, always, with one of five outcomes. Four
 * of them are not "pass":
 *
 * - `within`: measured, budgeted, at or below the limit;
 * - `over`: measured, budgeted, above the limit, with the dominant owners and the
 *   exact way back;
 * - `unbudgeted`: measured, but the production declared no limit, so nobody
 *   agreed what large means;
 * - `unsupported`: no analysis exists for what the design declares;
 * - `not-run`: the analysis exists but its input was not supplied.
 *
 * The last two make the whole report `incomplete`. That is the point of them:
 * an artifact whose fluid cost was never computed has not been cleared for
 * fluid cost, and a report that said `within` would be the exact false
 * capability claim this evidence exists to prevent.
 *
 * A budget limit that is negative, fractional or non-finite is an authoring
 * mistake and throws, rather than becoming a budget that can never be met.
 *
 * An `over` finding names somewhere the author can actually go. The limit is
 * compared against the inventory's own total, frame passes and all, but the
 * dominant-owner ranking is over the owners that hold their own cost; the
 * passes are counted among the owners the report does not name and stated in
 * the recovery as passes. A ranking that let them compete would put the same
 * name first in every production that lights nothing, and that name is a guide
 * pass no production declares.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/rendering/budgets.md#rendering-budget-decision Produces the per-metric within, over, unbudgeted, unsupported, and not-run decisions required for an actionable render budget.
 * @evidence requirements/rendering/budgets.md#rendering-budget-tiers Evaluates the exact limits supplied by the caller's declared tier without treating a cheaper profile as equivalent clearance.
 * @evidence requirements/rendering/budgets.md#rendering-budget-refusal Returns over and incomplete preflight results before rendering when a declared limit is exceeded or a required metric is unavailable.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/budgets-and-representation.md#lighting-budget-refusal Reports an over or incomplete lighting metric with its declared limit, dominant owner, and explicit recovery instead of silently dropping a source or shadow.
 * @evidence requirements/production-design/budgets-and-feasibility.md#production-design-budget-refusal Refuses an over-limit or unmeasured render metric with its dominant semantic owner before runtime degradation can hide the excess.
 * @evidence requirements/operations-and-recovery/resource-budgets-and-backpressure.md#operations-budget-admission-estimate Compares the pre-render resource estimate with declared limits and distinguishes ready, over-limit, and incomplete admission outcomes.
 * @evidence specifications/editorial-render-and-delivery/render-budget-identity-and-recovery.md#spec-render-budget-preflight Compares the complete worst-case inventory with declared limits and reports bounded dominant owners and recovery.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/light-transport-color-and-budget.md#clv-light-budget-report-refusal Applies the pre-render refusal report to light and shadow-map metrics without mutating the requested render profile.
 * @evidence specifications/narrative-and-intent/budgets-continuity-and-deliverables.md#narrative-intent-budget-feasibility-verdict Implements the render-preflight subset of feasibility by withholding a ready verdict from over, unsupported, or not-run required metrics.
 * @evidence specifications/execution-and-recovery/resource-budgets-and-backpressure.md#execution-budget-admission-estimate Converts exact or conservative render metrics and unknown gaps into the bounded preflight decision without scheduling the work.
 * @evidence specifications/execution-and-recovery/resource-budgets-and-backpressure.md#execution-domain-budget-refusal Returns the render-domain over-limit or incomplete verdict unchanged instead of selecting a cheaper quality profile or starting degraded work.
 * @evidence requirements/map/scale-and-populations.md#map-population-budget-refusal `evaluateAutoMovieRenderBudget` returns an over or incomplete population verdict with the measured count, declared limit, dominant owner, and recovery before rendering.
 * @evidence specifications/world-and-site/partition-lod-streaming-and-seams.md#world-site-population-budget-refusal The preflight report refuses an over-limit or unmeasured realized population without silently reducing the declared world population.

 * id is what makes the list a property of the production rather than of the
 * order the inventory happened to visit owners in, so two runs of the same
 * design produce the same eight names.
 *
 * Ranking and accounting are two questions and one list cannot answer both. A
 * frame pass redraws the geometry the drawable owners already paid for, so its
 * cost is their sum and it can never lose a cost-descending ranking: leaving it
 * in makes the first line of the table a constant, and for the outline pass it
 * makes that line a name no production declares and no author can open. So the
 * ranking is over `own` rows alone, while the passes stay in the omitted count
 * and the omitted cost. Nothing is dropped: the contributors plus the omitted
 * cost still add up to everything the inventory attributed, and the totals the
 * report checks against a limit are the inventory's own, untouched.
 *
 * The `instanceSlots` and `fluidCells` rankings never had this problem and do
 * not change: a resident cost is allocated once and reused by every pass, so no
 * pass row exists to outrank the drawable that owns it.
