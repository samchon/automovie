/**
 * Measure everything the design can answer for, and name everything it cannot.
 *
 * Every number below is arithmetic over authored geometry — a footprint's
 * shoelace area, a void's closed-form arc area, a route's polyline length, a
 * cell's cone decomposition — so a quantity cannot fall out of date with the
 * model it came from. Nothing is looked up, defaulted, or carried over from a
 * previous revision.
 *
 * Three things make the report usable rather than merely populated. Every
 * subject is answered for, always, so an absent quantity is a stated zero
 * rather than a missing row. Each finding says whether its total is exact or an
 * approximation and exactly what makes it approximate. And every quantity the
 * design cannot yet support is a gap, because a take-off that quietly left out
 * material would read as a building that needs none.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/interior/deliverables-and-quantities.md#interior-quantities-waste Derives each take-off value from resolved source geometry, identifies its contributing owners and unit, and names every unavailable or approximate result.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/deliverables-and-validation.md#interior-space-drawing-schedule-quantity Validates the environment, aggregates each canonical subject, rounds totals, records basis and omissions, sorts gaps, and seals the report with a deterministic digest.
 * @evidence requirements/building-exterior/deliverables.md#building-exterior-schedules-quantities `measureAutoMovieQuantities` derives identified area, volume, length, and count results from the same validated building geometry and marks exact, approximate, and unavailable subjects.
 * @evidence specifications/building-envelope/phases-deliverables-and-validation.md#building-envelope-deliverable-quantity-invariant The report implements stable owner contribution, unit, geometric basis, exactness, omission, and digest fields without claiming every assembly or waste quantity.
