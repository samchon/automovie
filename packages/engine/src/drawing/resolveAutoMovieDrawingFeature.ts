/**
 * Resolve one pinned feature against the design as it stands now.
 *
 * This is the whole of what keeps a note honest. The target stores where a
 * feature was, not what it measured, so moving a wall moves its dimension and
 * changes its number; and the target stores how many features of that kind
 * existed, so replacing a wall with a differently shaped one is reported stale
 * instead of relocating the note onto whichever feature inherited the index.
 *
 * The two outcomes are the only two: a feature this function cannot find is
 * never approximated to the nearest surviving one.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/interior/deliverables-and-quantities.md#interior-drawing-views Re-resolves a pinned drawing feature against current geometry so its annotation follows valid edits and exposes invalid ones.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/deliverables-and-validation.md#interior-space-drawing-schedule-quantity Verifies the authored feature identity and cardinality, transforms the exact match to world space, and returns stale rather than approximating a replacement.
