/**
 * Count one design's rooms, openings or connectors.
 *
 * The schedule and the drawing are two readings of one graph, so a door on the
 * plan and a row in the schedule cannot describe different doors: both come
 * from `environment.openings`, and `total` is that array's length by
 * construction. That is the whole point of deriving rather than drafting — a
 * schedule maintained beside a model is wrong the first time either is edited.
 *
 * Nominal dimensions come from the opening's own void where the design authored
 * one, and from the filling element's extent where it did not. The row says
 * which, because a leaf's bounding size is not the hole's and a schedule that
 * printed both as plain numbers would be ordered from. A type with neither
 * reports `unmeasured` with `null` dimensions and the schedule reports the gap;
 * it never prints a zero.
 *
 * A `space` row is that same discipline applied to a room. Its membership is
 * read from `builtEnvironmentSpaceNodes`, which is the declaration an element
 * and a population each make about the one space they occupy, and never from
 * the shape of an id: the id-prefix draft the `#1902` reviewer wrote beside the
 * model instead undercounted a hall of 312 staged things as 204 and turned five
 * consecutive "this is missing" reports into false ones. Its extent is two
 * boxes, the declared volume and the measured contents, because those are
 * different questions and reading the first as the second is what aimed three
 * of four review cameras at a wall.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/interior/deliverables-and-quantities.md#interior-schedules Groups the selected design occurrences into stable marks whose identity, counts, location, state, samples, and gaps reconcile with the model.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/deliverables-and-validation.md#interior-space-drawing-schedule-quantity Validates the environment, derives declared, profile or fill dimensions, canonicalizes rows and omission totals, declares unsupported performance, and hashes the schedule.
