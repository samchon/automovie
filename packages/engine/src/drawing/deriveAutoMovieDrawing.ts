 * Derive one drawing from one design.
 *
 * The design is validated first and an invalid one throws, for the same reason
 * `lowerBuiltEnvironment` refuses to lower one: a drawing of a building whose
 * graph does not resolve would be a picture of nothing, handed on as evidence.
 *
 * Everything below is computed. No line is drafted by hand, no dimension is
 * typed, and nothing produced here may be read back into the design: the
 * drawing is a projection of the model, so the two cannot disagree and the
 * model stays the only source of truth. What the derivation cannot compute is
 * reported in {@link IAutoMovieDrawing.gaps} rather than omitted, because a
 * sheet that silently leaves out what it could not work out reads as a building
 * that has none of it.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/interior/deliverables-and-quantities.md#interior-drawing-views Derives the requested view's actual page lines, space regions, annotations, extent, and unresolved gaps from the validated environment.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/deliverables-and-validation.md#interior-space-drawing-schedule-quantity Canonicalizes one validated environment and drawing view into deterministic cut geometry, projected geometry, feature resolutions, and a digest.
 * @evidence requirements/interior/deliverables-and-quantities.md#interior-deliverable-consistency `deriveAutoMovieDrawing` derives one identified view, geometry, annotations, gaps, and digest from the same validated built-environment record without copying an editable design.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/deliverables-and-validation.md#interior-space-capture-deliverable-consistency The drawing implements the shared-environment and deterministic-derived-output subset without claiming rendered captures or a full provenance manifest.
 * @evidence requirements/building-exterior/deliverables.md#building-exterior-drawing-views `deriveAutoMovieDrawing` resolves plan, elevation, and section frames, extent, scale, projected geometry, annotations, and gaps from the building state.
 * @evidence specifications/building-envelope/phases-deliverables-and-validation.md#building-envelope-deliverable-input-manifest The result preserves environment identity, view settings, coordinate frame, scale, and deterministic digest without claiming producer or generated-time fields.

 * The page box that holds everything the sheet puts on paper.

 * Dimensions and notes count, and they are why this is not simply the box
 * around the linework. A dimension string is drawn beside the plan rather than
 * across it and a note is led out past the wall it describes, so a box taken
 * from the geometry alone is a sheet whose own annotation hangs off the edge of
 * it — and the serializer sizes the page from this box, so what falls outside
 * is not merely close to the border, it is outside the viewBox and gone.
 *
 * A note contributes the point its text is set from and not the run of glyphs
 * that text becomes, which is the whole of what the derivation can know without
 * font metrics; the drawing declares that reach as a gap rather than letting
 * the box imply it measured the lettering. A stale target contributes nothing,
 * because it has no place on the page to be at.
