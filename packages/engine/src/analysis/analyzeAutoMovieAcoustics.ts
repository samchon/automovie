/**
 * Solve one room for reverberation, equipment noise and partition performance.
 *
 * Three closed forms, each stated so a reader can check the arithmetic:
 *
 * - The Sabine absorption `A = sum(S * alpha)` and `T60 = 0.161 * V / A`;
 * - The room constant `R = A / (1 - alpha_mean)`, and at each receiver `Lp = 10 *
 *   log10(sum over sources of 10^(Lw/10) * (Q / (4*pi*r^2) + 4/R))`, the direct
 *   field plus the diffuse field;
 * - The composite transmission loss `R_c = -10 * log10(sum(tau * S) / sum(S))`
 *   with `tau = 10^(-R/10)`, which is why one weak panel dominates a strong
 *   wall.
 *
 * The exclusions are stated as loudly as the results. A single broadband
 * absorption coefficient cannot produce a speech transmission index, which
 * needs a modulation transfer function over an impulse response, so that metric
 * is `unsupported` rather than estimated.
 *
 * The reverberation time, the room constant and the receiver level are all
 * statements about a diffuse field, so all three gap wherever there is none: a
 * room that absorbs nothing rings forever, and a room that absorbs everything
 * never rings at all. Neither extreme is reported as a number. The second is
 * the one worth naming, because Sabine does not diverge there but keeps
 * returning `0.161 * V / A`, a positive decay time for an anechoic chamber,
 * which is the arithmetic of the model rather than a property of the room.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/interior/acoustics-and-sound-boundaries.md#interior-acoustic-analysis-boundary `analyzeAutoMovieAcoustics` computes only reverberation, diffuse steady level, and composite transmission loss while returning explicit gaps for unsupported acoustic claims.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/lighting-acoustics-and-environment.md#interior-space-acoustic-boundary-scenario The solver validates the scenario, evaluates its three closed forms, records receiver samples, and seals the deterministic acoustic run.
 * @evidence requirements/interior/acoustics-and-sound-boundaries.md#interior-absorption-reverberation `analyzeAutoMovieAcoustics` combines declared surface area and absorption with room volume to compute the supported Sabine reverberation time and room constant, while reporting unavailable inputs as gaps.
 * @evidence requirements/interior/acoustics-and-sound-boundaries.md#interior-acoustic-zones-scenarios `analyzeAutoMovieAcoustics` seals one logical-space subject and revision with its declared surfaces, partitions, sources, receivers, targets, and bounded omissions as a reproducible scenario.
 * @evidence requirements/interior/acoustics-and-sound-boundaries.md#interior-sound-transmission `analyzeAutoMovieAcoustics` converts each declared partition reduction index to linear transmittance, combines it by area, and returns composite decibels or an explicit unbounded gap.
 * @evidence requirements/interior/materials-and-physical-properties.md#interior-material-analysis-boundary `analyzeAutoMovieAcoustics` solves only the declared closed-form acoustic metrics and leaves unsupported or unavailable material-dependent claims as explicit gaps and statuses.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/materials-style-and-art.md#interior-space-material-facts-analysis-boundary The acoustic solver consumes only supported declared physical facts and does not turn missing material behavior into a successful estimate.
