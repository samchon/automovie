/**
 * Measure one workplane under one declared instant, one set of shades and one
 * set of luminaires.
 *
 * The governing model is stated and bounded rather than implied:
 *
 * - Beam illuminance is `DNI * max(0, dot(n, s))`, zeroed when any solid stops
 *   the ray to the sun;
 * - Sky illuminance is the isotropic vault `DHI * V`, where `V` is the fraction
 *   of a cosine-weighted hemisphere that reaches the sky unobstructed and above
 *   the reference ground. Cosine weighting makes this exact, not approximate,
 *   for an unobstructed plane: every direction is visible, so `V` is one and
 *   the result is the declared horizontal illuminance for any sample count;
 * - Each luminaire contributes `I * max(0, dot(n, d)) / r^2`, zeroed when a solid
 *   stands between the fitting and the point;
 * - Ground-reflected light is **not** modelled, and says so as an `unsupported`
 *   metric rather than being quietly folded into the sky term.
 *
 * Anything the solver cannot answer is reported rather than approximated. A sky
 * model it does not implement returns an `unsupported` run; a study with
 * neither a sun nor a fitting returns `not-run`; a contrast ratio over a plane
 * with a dark point returns a gap, because `max / 0` is not a large number, it
 * is not a number.
 *
 * Everything the study is configured with is digested into the run, so two
 * identical requests produce one identical artifact and any change to shading,
 * time or grid produces a different one.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/interior/lighting-daylight-and-optics.md#interior-lighting-analysis-boundary `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` samples direct sun, isotropic sky, and declared point lights while naming every unsupported or unavailable lighting claim.
 * @evidence specifications/interior-space/lighting-acoustics-and-environment.md#interior-space-lighting-optical-state The solver validates all state, traces obstruction rays over ordered cell centres, derives bounded metrics, and seals one reproducible lighting run.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/analysis-and-visual-validation.md#lighting-analysis-contract `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` binds the subject and input revision to identified context, shade, source, workplane, instant, sky model, solver settings, targets, tolerances, and explicit omissions in one sealed run.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/analysis-and-visual-validation.md#lighting-measurable-results `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` returns ordered world samples and lux or ratio metrics with their units, grid, instant, settings, and unsupported ground-reflection gap.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/analysis-and-visual-validation.md#lighting-analysis-geometry-trace `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` seals the context revision, identified blocker planes, workplane normal, shade solids, and source positions into the ray-analysis settings and digest.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/analysis-and-visual-validation.md#lighting-deterministic-recheck `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` uses fixed workplane grids, a deterministic hemisphere sequence, stable source ordering, and a canonical settings digest so equal requests reproduce the same metrics.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/analysis-and-visual-validation.md#lighting-analysis-status `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` distinguishes solved metrics from unsupported sky or reflection claims and from a not-run request with no usable source.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/scope-and-identity.md#lighting-spatial-binding `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` evaluates identified source positions, one oriented workplane, context and shade blocker planes, and the input revision in the same world-coordinate sample.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/scope-and-identity.md#lighting-appearance-distinction `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` labels its bounded numeric method and status without presenting illuminance calculations as rendered appearance.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/sources-and-photometry.md#lighting-intensity-basis `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` consumes artificial intensity in declared candela and environment sun input as declared illuminance rather than treating them as interchangeable scalars.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/sources-and-photometry.md#lighting-photometric-quantity-semantics `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` converts candela into surface lux through incidence and squared distance while reporting direct, diffuse, artificial, and ratio metrics separately.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/sources-and-photometry.md#lighting-distance-falloff `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` applies the declared point-source inverse-square `I*cos(theta)/r^2` law and records a coincident-source warning instead of inventing a finite distance.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/sources-and-photometry.md#lighting-source-distribution `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` names and implements only isotropic point and isotropic sky distributions for this numeric solver.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/sources-and-photometry.md#lighting-source-refusal `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` rejects malformed workplanes, sources, blockers, and targets and reports an unsupported sky model rather than silently selecting another distribution.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/sun-sky-and-environment.md#lighting-declared-sun `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` reads only the selected context instant's declared sun direction, direct normal illuminance, and diffuse horizontal illuminance.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/sun-sky-and-environment.md#lighting-environment-geometry-trace `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` retains the context revision, ground, blocker planes, building shades, and instant identity in the run that consumes them.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/sun-sky-and-environment.md#lighting-environment-spatial-variation `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` evaluates each workplane cell against its own horizon, ground reference, and source-to-cell occlusion rays rather than applying one ambient value.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/sun-sky-and-environment.md#lighting-environment-time-sampling `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` evaluates the one explicitly selected environment instant and records that instant beside every resulting metric.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/sun-sky-and-environment.md#lighting-environment-claim-boundary `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` identifies its fixed isotropic model and omitted inter-reflection and uses unsupported or not-run status to prevent broader weather or global-illumination claims.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/shadows-reflections-and-transmission.md#lighting-shadow-time-sampling `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` tests source-to-workplane obstruction against the selected instant and the exact sealed blocker set for that analytic sample.
 * @evidence requirements/interior/lighting-daylight-and-optics.md#interior-daylight-path `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` samples the authored sun and isotropic sky at the selected instant through declared blockers onto the oriented workplane without claiming reflective-bounce transport.
 * @evidence requirements/interior/lighting-daylight-and-optics.md#interior-luminaire-distribution `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` evaluates the declared point-source position and intensity through occlusion, incidence, and inverse-square illuminance without claiming line, area, spot, spectral, or manufacturer photometry.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/alternatives-deviations-and-evidence.md#clv-evidence-sampling-recheck The sealed request closure, fixed sample sequences, and settings digest make the numeric lighting metrics directly recheckable without claiming a pixel or A/B review manifest.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/alternatives-deviations-and-evidence.md#clv-result-status-review-authority The solver keeps solved, unsupported, and not-run analysis states distinct and never promotes the numeric result into a rendered or human-review verdict.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/visibility-and-image-space-observation.md#clv-computable-geometry-results The ordered world samples and identified blocker geometry produce reproducible numeric lux and ratio observations.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/light-transport-color-and-budget.md#clv-shadow-state-sampling The solver fixes one current source, receiver grid, instant, and blocker state for each analytic shadow ray without claiming rendered or moving-shadow extrema.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/light-source-photometry-and-environment.md#clv-light-authority-branches The analysis keeps its declared numeric source and spatial binding separate from appearance and authoring authority.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/light-source-photometry-and-environment.md#clv-source-distribution-color The solver implements the declared isotropic point distribution and candela-to-lux incidence and falloff calculation as its supported photometric subset.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/light-source-photometry-and-environment.md#clv-source-sampling-refusal Invalid source quantities or geometry and unsupported sky distributions are refused at the analysis boundary instead of being normalized into success.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/light-source-photometry-and-environment.md#clv-environment-image-spatial-variation The workplane, declared sun, ground, shade, and blocker geometry materially implement the specification's spatial environment-analysis branch without claiming image-background or reflection support.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/light-source-photometry-and-environment.md#clv-environment-sampling-claims The named instant, sky model, settings, and unsupported gaps bound exactly which environmental lighting claims the numeric run can make.
 * @evidence requirements/building-exterior/lighting-and-optics.md#building-exterior-lighting-review `analyzeAutoMovieDaylight` fixes the source revision, environment instant, sun, sky, point luminaires, blocker geometry, workplane, samples, and numeric findings without claiming a rendered review.
 * @evidence specifications/building-envelope/exterior-spaces-circulation-and-optics.md#building-envelope-optical-input-review-condition The solver implements the fixed natural-and-artificial lighting scenario and measured-observation subset while reflection, transmission, camera capture, and approval remain unsupported.
