/**
 * Validate the bindings that make independent planting clusters a building's
 * planting.
 *
 * This is the seam, and it is deliberately one-directional: the architecture
 * record knows nothing about plants, and the planting records know nothing
 * about architecture. The installation is the only place the names meet, so
 * this is the only place their agreement can be checked — that the cited space
 * is a real logical space of the cited environment, that the support really is
 * the surface, element or boundary it claims, that the irrigation port resolves
 * to an element, that a `green-wall` is trained against something vertical
 * rather than resting on a floor patch, that an `aquatic` planting actually
 * stands in a fluid domain and that a dry one does not pretend to, and that
 * every generated member lands inside the room instead of through its wall.
 *
 * A room declared as a purely semantic container (a logical space that states
 * no volume at all) is not geometrically checked: there is no volume to check
 * against, and inventing one would be the design deciding a fact the author did
 * not state.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/interior/soft-materials-plants-and-deformation.md#interior-soft-anchor-host Validates the planting's declared room, support, irrigation, and host bindings.
