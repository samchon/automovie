/**
 * Analytic two-bone arm IK that **respects the mid joint's hinge**.
 *
 * The predecessor ({@link twoBoneChainArticulation}) solves the mid joint as a
 * free swing, `aimRotation(localFore, localGoal)`, which generically decomposes
 * into abduction and twist. An elbow declares those axes immobile, so the pose
 * was illegal by construction, and the bend plane came from a world-down pole
 * that is right for a knee and bends an elbow backwards. On the canonical
 * humanoid under the engine's own default ROM table that combination produced a
 * ROM-violating pose for essentially every target, including targets where
 * valid poses provably exist (#1345).
 *
 * This solve inverts the split. The mid joint rotates **only** about its own
 * flexion axis, so its abduction and twist are zero by construction and the
 * bend plane is the hinge's own plane rather than a pole's guess. The interior
 * bend follows in closed form: writing the chain-root-to-effector span as a
 * function of the hinge angle `θ` gives
 *
 *     |m(θ)|² = k + α·cos θ + β·sin θ
 *
 * So `|m(θ)| = distance` is `R·cos(θ − φ) = distance² − k`, an arccos with the
 * chain's two bend branches as its two roots, and a target outside the span
 * clamps to the fully extended or fully folded end exactly as the
 * law-of-cosines solve did.
 *
 * The chain-root joint keeps the residual freedom, and that freedom is
 * **exact**: any extra rotation about `m(θ)` leaves the effector where it is,
 * so the whole swivel circle reaches the target. Spending it costs no accuracy,
 * which is why the candidates are scored on the rig's own ROM rather than on
 * residual. Among candidates the choice is lexicographic: legality first, then
 * the least articulation from the **anatomical neutral**. The angles are
 * clinical, so all-zero is "standing, arms at the sides", the same origin
 * `DEFAULT_HUMANOID_ROM` is written about, which makes a quadratic in those
 * degrees a least-effort posture prior stated in the convention's own terms
 * rather than an appeal to how a render looks.
 *
 * `R ≈ 0` means the hinge cannot change the span at all (it is parallel to the
 * far segment), the degeneracy {@link armChainFault} names; the solve returns
 * `null` rather than inventing a pose for a rig that has no reach shell.
 *
 * Returns `null` for a degenerate chain: a zero-length segment, a target
 * coincident with the chain root, or a hinge that cannot articulate the span.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/motion/constraints-and-inverse-kinematics.md#motion-constraint-reachability Searches the declared hinge's reachable shell for an exact endpoint pose.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/kinematics-contact-and-interaction.md#performance-contact-phase-weight-support Returns the deterministic outcome of the legal-first bounded articulation search.
