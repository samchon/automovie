/**
 * Per-bone clinical axes for the **canonical humanoid rest pose** (VRM T-pose:
 * arms out along ±X, legs down −Y), parallel to `DEFAULT_HUMANOID_ROM`.
 *
 * Only the arm chain needs remapping. A T-pose arm points along its local X, so
 * the default basis would make `flexion` roll the arm along its length instead
 * of swinging it fore/aft. Mapping flexion→Y and twist→X (abduction stays Z)
 * makes the clinical angles anatomically correct: `flexion` swings the arm
 * sagittally (a walk's arm-swing), `abduction` raises it to the side (a jumping
 * jack), `twist` rotates it about its length. Legs and spine already align with
 * the default basis, so they are omitted (and fall back to it).
 *
 * Opt in by passing this to {@link resolvePose} / `applyPose`; a bone absent
 * from the table uses {@link DEFAULT_JOINT_AXES}.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/asset-authoring/rig-and-state.md#asset-rig-basis-controls Declares the canonical humanoid's semantic controls in each bone's local basis.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/rig-deformation-and-retargeting.md#performance-rig-rom-control-driver-graph Maps the canonical semantic controls onto the T-pose arm basis.
