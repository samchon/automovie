/**
 * Whether an arm chain can be articulated at all by the analytic arm IK,
 * decided from the rig rather than from a convention's name.
 *
 * `HUMANOID_JOINT_AXES` maps the arm's `flexion` onto local **+Y** because the
 * canonical humanoid rests in the VRM T-pose, arms out along local ±X. That
 * table is applied unconditionally by every arm computation on the surface, and
 * on a rig that rests otherwise it can name an axis the bone cannot use: when
 * the elbow's flexion axis lies along the forearm's own rest direction, elbow
 * flexion is a **roll**, so the hand does not move at all and the arm is a
 * rigid stick. The chain then has one reachable radius instead of a shell, and
 * every downstream answer about it is wrong while every validator stays green
 * (#1346).
 *
 * The test is first-principles rather than a T-pose sniff, which matters
 * because the humanoid bone enum is the only vocabulary the surface has: a
 * retargeted quadruped's FRONT legs ride the arm chains and legitimately rest
 * along −Y. Such a rig is refused only where an arm-IK question is actually
 * asked of it, never at authoring time, so a quadruped that never reaches stays
 * free.
 *
 * Returns `null` when the chain is solvable, and `null` for a chain whose bones
 * are missing entirely (that is {@link reachPose}'s own "no measurable arm"
 * answer, a different fact from a rig whose elbow cannot bend).
 *
 * @evidence requirements/motion/constraints-and-inverse-kinematics.md#motion-constraint-reachability Rejects a two-bone chain whose declared hinge cannot displace its endpoint.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/kinematics-contact-and-interaction.md#performance-contact-phase-weight-support Refuses a chain whose hinge axis cannot move its endpoint.
