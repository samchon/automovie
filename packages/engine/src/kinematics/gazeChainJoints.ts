/**
 * Distribute one aim over the **gaze chain** (`neck` → `head`) as the joints
 * the rig declares can legally hold it.
 *
 * `lookAt` used to put the entire solved angle on `head` alone, so a gaze the
 * chain could easily reach came out breaking the rig's own ROM: 47.7 degrees of
 * flexion on a `head` declared `[-30, 30]` while the `neck` declared `[-50,
 * 60]` sat at zero, with a legal split available in every direction (#1360).
 * The author cannot correct that by authoring differently, because the gaze
 * angle is engine-solved from the target and the rig; the only recovery left
 * was widening the head bone until one joint carried the whole cervical range,
 * which makes the rig lie about the body. This is #1345's fix for the arm
 * chain, one joint up: a solver must not emit a pose the declared chain forbids
 * when the declared chain admits one.
 *
 * **Head first, neck for the remainder.** The head's own rotation is what
 * points the eyes, so it takes as much as its declared range legally holds and
 * the neck is recruited only for what is left. That makes the distribution a
 * strict extension of the single-bone aim: every gaze the head could already
 * hold compiles to exactly the pose it compiled to before, and the neck appears
 * in the pose only when it actually carries something.
 *
 * The two joints' clinical angles ADD along the chain: neither bone is in
 * {@link HUMANOID_JOINT_AXES}, so both use the default basis, and the canonical
 * humanoid rests with the cervical chain straight, which is what makes 17.7
 * degrees of neck flexion plus 30 of head flexion aim the head exactly where
 * 47.7 degrees on the head alone aimed it.
 *
 * **A chain that genuinely cannot span the aim keeps failing, unclamped.** What
 * neither joint can take stays on the head, so the shot's ROM gate reports it
 * with the head's overshoot equal to the amount by which the whole declared
 * chain falls short. That is the `reach` precedent exactly ("an impossible
 * reach fails the shot's ROM gate rather than being quietly bent into range"):
 * bending the aim into range instead would silently point the actor somewhere
 * it was never told to look.
 *
 * Without a rig (`null`), or on a rig that declares no `neck` bone, the pose is
 * the single `head` joint this always emitted. A rig-less actor context runs no
 * ROM gate at all in {@link performShot} (its `skeleton` lookup returns null),
 * so there is nothing to distribute for, and naming a bone the skeleton does
 * not declare would trade one violation for another.
 *
 * @param props.rig The actor's resolved skeleton, or `null` when it has none.
 * @param props.flexionDeg Sagittal aim (tilt): `+` down, matching the pose
 *   axis.
 * @param props.twistDeg Transverse aim (turn) about the chain's long axis.
 * @returns The joints of the aim pose, parent first.
 * @evidence requirements/actors/pose-expression-and-gaze.md#actor-gaze-attention Distributes an authored target through the reachable cervical chain within its declared bounds.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/kinematics-contact-and-interaction.md#performance-kinematics-gaze-expression-attention Solves the bounded cervical chain while retaining an explicit residual for impossible aims.
