/**
 * Resolve a {@link IAutoMoviePose} against its {@link IAutoMovieSkeleton} into
 * per-bone transforms (forward kinematics).
 *
 * For each bone it composes the rest-pose local rotation with the pose's
 * articulation ({@link jointToQuaternion}), then walks the parent hierarchy to
 * accumulate world positions. The result feeds two consumers:
 *
 * - The **renderer**, which sets each bone's `localRotation` and lets the scene
 *   graph compute world transforms (so `worldPosition` is informational
 *   there);
 * - **physics-style validators**, which need world positions (e.g. foot-ground
 *   contact, centre of mass).
 *
 * Bones are processed parent-before-child via a topological walk from the root,
 * so a parent's world transform is always available when a child is resolved.
 *
 * **Contract: only root-reachable bones are resolved.** The walk starts from
 * null-parent roots and follows the parent links, so a bone with an orphaned
 * parent reference, a detached sub-tree, or a cyclic parent chain (every member
 * has a non-null parent, so none is entered from a root: no infinite recursion
 * results, since a bone is reached only through its single parent) is **omitted
 * from the result**, and a skeleton with no root at all resolves to an empty
 * array. This is load-bearing: {@link reachableBoneNames} derives the reachable
 * set from the same walk, and graceful consumers (a physics validator gating a
 * bone, `retargetHumanoidMotion` measuring rest height) rely on the partial
 * return to report a malformed rig instead of crashing. A consumer that needs
 * every declared bone present must gate on {@link reachableBoneNames} first: the
 * total, non-throwing "which bones will resolve" query.
 *
 * `jointAxes` optionally remaps the clinical axes per bone (e.g.
 * `HUMANOID_JOINT_AXES`, so a T-pose arm's flexion swings it sagittally); a
 * bone absent from it uses the default clinical basis, so omitting it preserves
 * the baseline behavior exactly.
 *
 * `restFrames` optionally reads each joint's angles as **clinical** and maps
 * them into that bone's rest-relative space (e.g. `HUMANOID_REST_FRAME`, so
 * `+abduction` raises either arm despite the shared axis); a bone absent from
 * it, or an omitted table, is the identity. The angles are taken as the rig's
 * own.
 *
 * `topology` optionally reuses a pose-independent hierarchy index built by
 * {@link indexSkeletonTopology}. Omit it for one-off calls, especially if the
 * skeleton object may have been mutated since a prior resolve.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/actors/pose-expression-and-gaze.md#actor-pose-space-authority Composes each bone-local authored pose through its declared parent hierarchy into one resolved state.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/actor-identity-state-and-fidelity.md#performance-actor-pose-gaze-expression-state Evaluates the current body pose into deterministic per-bone transforms.
