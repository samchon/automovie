/**
 * Analytic two-bone IK for an arm: the {@link IAutoMoviePose} (upper-arm +
 * forearm articulation) that brings the `side` hand onto `target`, in the
 * skeleton's own model space. This is the harness `reach` verb made concrete:
 * the model says "put your right hand on the lever" and the engine solves the
 * shoulder and elbow that land it there, deterministically, no solver
 * iteration.
 *
 * It reads the arm's segment lengths and rest directions from the skeleton's
 * rest FK, then solves the chain with {@link hingedArmArticulation}: the elbow
 * turns only about its own flexion axis (so its abduction and twist are zero by
 * construction, which is exactly what an elbow's immobile axes require), and
 * the shoulder spends the chain's exact swivel freedom on staying inside the
 * rig's declared range of motion. An unreachable target extends the arm fully
 * toward it (the hand stops on the reachable shell) rather than failing.
 *
 * **The angles come out CLINICAL.** {@link IAutoMovieJointPose} defines itself
 * as semantic clinical angles precisely so a generated angle can be checked
 * against the ROM table by a direct per-axis comparison, which is what
 * {@link validatePose} does. The clinical axes and the rest frame are two halves
 * of ONE convention, so this function owns both: it applies
 * {@link HUMANOID_JOINT_AXES} unconditionally, and therefore defaults
 * `restFrames` to the matching {@link HUMANOID_REST_FRAME}. Leaving the frame to
 * the caller made `getReach` (which passed it) and `perform`'s arm verbs (which
 * usually did not) answer the same rig in two different spaces, and the
 * rest-relative one was then judged against the clinical table off by the
 * shoulder's whole 90-degree rest abduction (#1346). Pass an explicit table for
 * a rig with its own rest convention, or `{}` for raw rig-space angles.
 *
 * Returns `null` if the arm bones are missing, the chain is geometrically
 * degenerate, or the rig's elbow cannot bend the arm at all under these axes
 * ({@link armChainFault}): a rig that cannot reach.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/motion/constraints-and-inverse-kinematics.md#motion-constraint-reachability Solves an arm only within the reachable set of its declared chain.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/kinematics-contact-and-interaction.md#performance-contact-phase-weight-support Produces a bounded clinical arm pose for the reach target.
