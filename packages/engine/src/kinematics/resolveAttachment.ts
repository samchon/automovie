/**
 * Resolve the **world transform of a child model's root** rigidly coupled to a
 * bone of a posed parent skeleton, the cross-skeleton joint behind a rider on a
 * horse, a sword in a hand, a passenger in a cart.
 *
 * It runs forward kinematics on the parent ({@link resolvePose}), reads the
 * attachment bone's world position + orientation, and composes the
 * {@link IAutoMovieAttachment} offset into that frame:
 *
 * - `translation = boneWorldPos + boneWorldRot · offset.translation`
 * - `rotation = boneWorldRot ∘ offset.rotation`
 *
 * So the child inherits both where the bone is and how it is turned: as a horse
 * rears and its chest pitches back, the seat (and the rider locked to it) pitch
 * with it, exactly as a physics fixed-joint would carry one body on another.
 * Feed the returned transform to the child as its root each frame.
 *
 * Throws if the skeleton has no such bone (a mis-wired attachment is a bug, not
 * a silently-skipped frame).
 *
 * `restFrames` must match the renderer's pose path when the parent motion is
 * authored in clinical space; otherwise a prop would ride raw rig-space FK
 * while the visible parent is read through its clinical frame.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/actors/appearance-costume-and-attachments.md#actor-attachment-contact Keeps the child root rigidly registered to its authored parent-bone contact frame.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/actor-identity-state-and-fidelity.md#performance-actor-appearance-costume-attachment Resolves rigid attachment state against the parent's current posed frame.
