 *
 * Both solvers work on the chain's world positions with rigid segment lengths
 * and a **fixed iteration budget** (`driver.iterations`, else
 * {@link DEFAULT_ITERATIONS}) plus a convergence early-out
 * ({@link CONVERGENCE_EPSILON}). Same inputs, same output, always. CCD sweeps
 * the joints back-to-front rotating each toward the goal; FABRIK runs
 * backward/forward position passes (and resolves an out-of-reach goal as full
 * extension toward it). After the positional solve each joint's world rotation
 * gets the shortest-arc delta of its segment, the result is blended by
 * `influence`, and, matching the two-bone convention, the tip's subtree
 * recomposes.
