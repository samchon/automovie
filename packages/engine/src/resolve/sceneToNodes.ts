/**
 * Lower the specialized {@link IAutoMovieScene} onto the general
 * {@link IAutoMovieNode} graph, slice S3 of the core wiring: the same scene the
 * film pipeline stages becomes the flat node list {@link composeScene} composes,
 * so scene placement, cameras, lights, and (when models are supplied) every
 * actor's bone hierarchy all live in ONE graph the general Clip path can
 * animate.
 *
 * **Structure, not state.** The bridge lowers the scene's REST structure: each
 * scene node becomes a `group` node at its world placement, each camera/light a
 * `camera`/`light` node carrying its id as the payload ref. What a node is
 * _doing_ (a running motion, a held pose) arrives as `composeScene` overrides,
 * exactly how the general pipeline animates everything else: bake the motion
 * (or a constant-pose motion) through `motionToClip` with `nodePrefix:
 * "<placementId>/"` and feed the clip to `resolveFrame` over these nodes.
 *
 * **Naming.** A placed model's subtree is prefixed `${sceneNode.id}/` (root
 * `${id}/root`, bones `${id}/${bone}`), so two actors sharing bone names stay
 * distinct in the one graph, the same prefix the actor's clip channels must
 * carry ({@link motionToClip}'s `nodePrefix`). A placed prop's articulation
 * lowers the same way (`${id}/hinge`), and its profile binds with the same
 * prefix (`bindProfile`'s `nodePrefix`).
 *
 * **Guards.** When either registry is supplied, every placed `model` ref must
 * resolve in their union: a lossless bridge refuses silent drops; omit both for
 * a placements-only lowering (no subtrees). A prop-frame caller may explicitly
 * set `allowPartialModels` to omit unrelated actor/set subtrees while retaining
 * the full placement graph. An id present in BOTH registries throws: the
 * registries contradict, and a forged prop already carries its own model, so it
 * never needs a `models` entry. A skeleton-less model lowers no subtree; a
 * rigid prop (`articulation: null`) lowers none either. Duplicate node ids and
 * dangling parents are rejected downstream by `composeScene`'s index guard.
 * This bridge does not duplicate that gate.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/map/scope-and-coordinates.md#map-host-scene-placement Lowers each staged placement into an explicit host-scene relation.
 * @evidence requirements/rendering/scene-lowering-and-runtime-state.md#rendering-lowering-ownership Retains the placement, model, prop, camera, and light identities that own every lowered scene node.
 * @evidence requirements/rendering/scene-lowering-and-runtime-state.md#rendering-lowering-refusal Rejects a missing model binding or contradictory model-and-prop registration instead of silently omitting the declared subtree.
 * @evidence specifications/world-and-site/spatial-reference-and-identity.md#world-site-host-placement-failure Rejects a placement whose declared model binding cannot resolve.
 * @evidence specifications/editorial-render-and-delivery/render-schedule-state-and-headless.md#spec-render-state-isolation Builds the explicit rest-structure graph that runtime sampling updates without mutating the authored scene record.
