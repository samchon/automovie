/**
 * The APPLY pass for light animation: evaluate a shot's `lightMotions` at
 * `seconds` and return the scene's lights carrying their values at that
 * instant.
 *
 * This is the consumer that makes the light-time axis real (#1348). A shot may
 * state that a candle burns at 1.4 candela until 1.55s and 0.04 after it, and
 * anything reading only the committed artifacts (`scene.json` for the lights,
 * `shots/<beat>.json` for the clips) evaluates that statement to a number at
 * any frame, deterministically: the same inputs always yield the same lights,
 * exactly as `resolveFrame` does for node transforms.
 *
 * A light no clip touches is returned **by identity**, so a film that never
 * changes its light produces the same lights it produced before this pass
 * existed.
 *
 * Malformed input throws rather than resolving to something plausible, the same
 * contract `resolveFrame` holds for a clip naming a missing node: a light clip
 * reaching here has passed `validateShotArtifact`, so a track that addresses no
 * staged light, or a property the staged light's kind does not carry, is a
 * broken artifact and not a case to skip. Silently dropping it is the failure
 * #1349 named.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/sources-and-photometry.md#lighting-source-time-sampling Samples every admitted light channel at one shot-local instant.
 * @evidence requirements/lighting/temporal-state-and-continuity.md#lighting-state-time-sampling Evaluates every shot-light clip directly at the requested shot-local second without integrating previous-frame state.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/light-source-photometry-and-environment.md#clv-source-sampling-refusal Rejects a sampled channel outside the staged source authority.
 * @evidence specifications/camera-light-and-visibility/temporal-state-and-continuity.md#clv-light-cue-observation Resolves the staged light state from the explicit sample time shared by all admitted channels.
