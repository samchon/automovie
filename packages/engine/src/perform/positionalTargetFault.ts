/**
 * Why a positional target did not resolve to a world point, phrased as the
 * clause after "but".
 *
 * The discriminator is the fault only for a relative or unknown kind. A `node`
 * or `group` target names a legal kind and an id that is not placed, so echoing
 * the kind made one sentence list a node target as valid and reject it at the
 * same time, leaving the correction round nothing it could act on (#1294). Name
 * the id instead: it is the only thing the author can fix.
 *
 * Total over `unknown` because the callers differ in how much they have already
 * validated: the perform gate reaches here only past its own shape checks,
 * while the production geometry queries hand over whatever the agent sent.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/staging/interactions-and-choreography.md#staging-interaction-refusal Returns an actionable correction for a positional target that cannot resolve.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/staging-space-state-and-choreography.md#performance-staging-interaction-choreography-role Implements the refusal reason for an unresolved choreography target.
