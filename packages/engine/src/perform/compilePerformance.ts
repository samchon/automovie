 * Compile a shot's flat {@link IAutoMovieActionCall} list into **one performance

 * engine primitives do not: it **splits unison actions** (`actor: string[]`)
 * onto each actor's timeline; **expands `repeat`** by concatenating the
 * synthesised cycle ({@link sequenceMotion}); and groups each actor's actions by
 * **body region**. Actions sharing a region are placed on one timeline and
 * **held across gaps** ({@link arrangeMotion}): they take turns. Actions on
 * **disjoint** regions are **layered** ({@link layerClips}): a walk can play at
 * the same time as a content-disjoint gesture or look-at. Actions in one broad
 * region normally share an arranged timeline; when two overlap on disjoint
 * carried bones they receive separate lanes and layer without either being
 * truncated. The per-action keyframes come entirely from `synthesize`. A `null`
 * synthesis is skipped.
 *
 * The builder also **states what it did not apply**: every clip the region
 * mask trimmed rides back on `masked` (#1349), so the caller that owns the
 * success envelope can refuse or report it instead of returning a clip that
 * silently omits half of what the author asked for.
 *
 * @param actions The shot's action calls (any order; arranged by `start`).
