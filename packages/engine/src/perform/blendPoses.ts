/**
 * Blend several pose layers by **weighted additive composition**: per bone, per
 * axis (flexion / abduction / twist), the result is the weight-normalized sum
 * of the layers that set that axis. A `null` axis contributes nothing and does
 * not dilute the others, so a single layer at weight 1 reproduces its own value
 * exactly, which makes this a drop-in for the last-wins {@link mergePoses} on
 * the disjoint-region layering path (no bone is set twice there), while adding
 * real blending when layers genuinely overlap on an axis (e.g. a carry pose
 * plus a reaction flinch on the same arm).
 *
 * The blend never clamps: a weighted result outside a joint's ROM stays out of
 * range so `validateMotion` reports it. The model must reweigh or reposition,
 * the engine does not hide it. Root: the last `ownsRoot` layer, else the last
 * non-null root; skeleton: the first layer's. The input must be non-empty.
 *
 * Weights are supplied by the caller; deriving them from action priority or an
 * IK solver is a later pass.

 * @evidence requirements/motion/layers-blends-and-transitions.md#motion-layer-mask-weight Applies the declared layer weights independently per authored joint axis.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/motion-sampling-and-composition.md#performance-motion-layer-mask-transition-composition Performs the specified weighted layer composition without inventing authority.
