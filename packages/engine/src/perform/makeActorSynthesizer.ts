 * already defined as "where a `lookAt` aims from", so using it as where a

 *
 * The key set is identical to the placement table's, so the perform gate (which
 * asks only whether a target resolves) and this synthesizer can never disagree
 * about which ids are legal. Routing the lift through the table rather than
 * through the verb is what makes a `group` target average EYE points instead of
 * ground points without a second code path.
 *
 * **Only `lookAt` reads this table**, and that is a decision, not an oversight.
 * `locomote` walks to a place on the ground, so its destination is the
 * placement itself. The arm verbs (`reach`, the `point` and `strike` gestures)
 * do not reach for eyes, and no measured chest/hand datum exists on the context
 * to lift them by; each of those branches says so where it resolves.

/**
 * Build a reference {@link IAutoMovieActionSynthesizer} (the content seam

 * **deterministically** from an actor's context:
 *
 * - `locomote` → the actor's matching {@link IAutoMovieGait}; if its target
 *   resolves to a world point ({@link resolveTargetPoint}, against `nodes`), the
 *   gait is carried that far at the actor's speed ({@link locomoteMotion}),
 *   otherwise it steps in place (a relative target, "off to the left", has no
 *   positional point yet). Either way an explicit `duration` sets the clip's
 *   span ({@link fitDeclaredSpan}) and `"auto"` keeps the engine's own sizing;
 * - `hold` → the actor's rest pose held for the duration ({@link holdMotion});
 * - `lookAt` → the gaze chain turned to aim at a resolved target, resolved
 *   against the **aim points** rather than the raw placements (see below), and
 *   distributed over `neck`/`head` by the context's declared ROM when it
 *   carries a `rig` ({@link gazeChainJoints});
 * - `emote` → a face-region expression clip;
 * - `gesture` → the postural/whole-body gestures (bow/nod/shake/crouch/kick/
 *   stagger/wave/celebrate/jump) via {@link gestureMotion}, plus the reachPose
 *   arm gestures: `point` (arm extended toward `at`, held) and `strike` (a jab
 *   thrown at `at`, then retracted); the remaining combat kinds return null;
 * - `reach` → analytic two-bone arm IK to a resolved target ({@link reachPose}),
 *   the target dropped into the actor's model space; needs the context's `rig`
 *   and is left unclamped so an impossible reach fails the shot's ROM gate;
 * - `react` → a ROM-clamped flinch away from the blow ({@link reactMotion}),
 *   decomposed into the actor's frame so a front hit snaps the torso back and a
 *   side hit leans it; needs the context's `rig` (the flinch is bounded by
 *   joint ROM), so a rig-less context synthesises nothing for it.
 *
 * Every other verb returns `null` (the host supplies its rig-specific content,
 * or a richer synthesiser does), and an unknown actor returns `null`. This is
 * the bridge that makes the action builder actually produce motion from the
 * declarative gait/profile data: the thin verb in, dense motion out.
 *
 * `lookAt` resolves against {@link aimPointsOf} instead of `nodes` because a
 * placement is a **ground** point: staging writes an actor's position straight
 * into its node transform, and a humanoid rig's origin sits between its feet,
 * so "look at him" aimed the head at the floor and two actors at conversational
 * range could not regard each other at all (1.6 m of eye height over 0.7 m of
 * separation is 66.37 degrees of flexion against a 45 degree head limit). The
 * camera solve met the same wall and answered it with a measured aim fraction
 * of the subject's height; this is the aim verbs' half of that answer, using
 * the one datum the context already carries for exactly this purpose. Since
 * #1360 that same 66.37 degrees is legal on a declared chain, which does not
 * soften the reason: a gaze aimed between the subject's feet is a stoop, and
 * the lift is what makes it a look.
