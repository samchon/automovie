const USAGE = `automovie: scaffold an automovie project

Usage:
  npx create-automovie <directory> --language <chinese|english|japanese|korean> [--force]
  npx automovie start <directory> --language <chinese|english|japanese|korean> [--force]
  npx automovie toc [--check]
  npx automovie inspect-external <path> --profile <profile>
  npx automovie routes <film|brief|library>

Commands:
  start <directory>   Create <directory> and lay down the blank scaffold:
                      authoring documents, local skills, and source lint.
  toc                  Generate canonical script and screenplay index links.
  inspect-external     Inspect exact glTF, GLB, or VRM bytes for explicit
                       externalMotions adoption without semantic mapping.
  routes <kind>        Print the complete owner/input/consumer route
                       matrix for one production kind.

Options:
  --force             Scaffold into a non-empty directory (start only).
  --language <name>   Install exactly one production-authoring language pack.
  --check             Refuse a stale delivery table of contents (toc only).
  --profile <name>    Select gltf-static-v1, gltf-humanoid-v1,
                      gltf-motion-v1, or vrm-humanoid-v1.
  -h, --help          Show this help as a standalone request.
  -v, --version       Print the version as a standalone request.

 * @evidenceExclude requirements/operations-and-recovery/idempotency-and-side-effects.md#operations-duplicate-submission Materializing a project is `@automovie/template`'s write, and the duplicate-write boundary is captured there against a physical directory identity.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/operations-and-recovery/idempotency-and-side-effects.md#operations-idempotent-deterministic-results The deterministic byte result belongs to the renderer and writer in `@automovie/template`; the executable only routes a command to them.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/capability-and-content-boundary.md#spec-authoring-capability-extension-compatibility Additive capability arrives through the packages a generated project installs, which the template pins; the executable adds no contract of its own.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/knowledge-evidence-and-tool-boundary.md#spec-authoring-knowledge-request-output The executable routes explicit commands and does not answer topic, contract, guide, support-status, or validation-path knowledge queries.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/knowledge-evidence-and-tool-boundary.md#spec-authoring-tool-choice-discovery The executable does not compare authoring techniques, execution providers, quality tiers, or partial-work choices.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/knowledge-evidence-and-tool-boundary.md#spec-authoring-host-evidence-output The executable creates or dispatches a project but does not observe an exact production target or return a runtime evidence receipt.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/knowledge-evidence-and-tool-boundary.md#spec-authoring-tool-authoring-invariant Project creation and render dispatch are intentional writes rather than read-only knowledge or evidence requests.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/knowledge-evidence-and-tool-boundary.md#spec-authoring-tool-content-side-effect-invariant No knowledge or evidence request reaches this executable, so it owns neither content response nor external-execution authorization for such a request.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/knowledge-evidence-and-tool-boundary.md#spec-authoring-tool-diagnostic-failure CLI usage and delegated-process failures are not knowledge-host refusals for stale evidence or unsupported authoring capability.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/agent-authoring/project-ownership.md#agent-sandbox-write-boundary The installed CLI creates only the explicitly selected project; it does not own the repository's experimental workspace or authorize an experiment there.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/source-authority-and-derivation.md#spec-authoring-sandbox-physical-ownership The installed project dispatcher does not select repository experiment roots, pack workspace packages, or install experiment dependencies.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/source-authority-and-derivation.md#spec-authoring-change-impact-report The CLI creates authoring documents and does not evaluate production source changes or produce an impact report.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/source-authority-and-derivation.md#spec-authoring-derivation-output-lineage The CLI publishes scaffold bytes and records no production output lineage.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/source-authority-and-derivation.md#spec-authoring-source-change-impact-invariant The invariant binds a source change to its downstream impact inside a production, which exists only after this command has finished.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/execution-and-recovery/retry-backoff-and-idempotency.md#execution-deterministic-result-reuse Reuse of an identical result is decided by the writer's captured directory generation in `@automovie/template`.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/execution-and-recovery/retry-backoff-and-idempotency.md#execution-duplicate-submission The executable carries no submission identity; the write it delegates to owns that boundary.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/operations-and-recovery/contract-baseline.md#operations-contract-baseline-identity The source-first CLI carries no serialized production or contract migration protocol; reviewed source changes and Git own that transition.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/operations-and-recovery/contract-migration-plan.md#operations-contract-migration-plan The source-first CLI carries no serialized production or contract migration protocol; reviewed source changes and Git own that transition.

 * @evidence specifications/execution-and-recovery/retry-backoff-and-idempotency.md#execution-alias-visible-bytes Supplies exact file and parent snapshots without aliased-entry replacement authority, preserving the writer's refusal of shared-inode mutation.
