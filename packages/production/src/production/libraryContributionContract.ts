 * Validate one library result against the active semantic owner branch.
 *
 * The current library protocol has exactly three result carriers: adopted
 * worlds, reusable models, and built environments. Their map, model, and space
 * owners must return a nonempty payload only in the carrier that branch owns.
 * Material, instance, motion, and system source branches remain legitimate
 * authoring populations, but no standalone library-result carrier exists for
 * them yet, so compilation refuses their result explicitly instead of
 * promoting a structurally convenient nested record as completion.
