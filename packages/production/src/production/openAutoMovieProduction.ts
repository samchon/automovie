/**
 * What makes a directory the root of one generated production project.
 *
 * Both markers already exist for reasons of their own, which is the point: the
 * walk reads the project's own identity rather than a reserved state directory
 * it would then have to create in order to be found. `package.json` names the
 * project and the production namespace derived from it, and `lint.config.ts`
 * is the one typed declaration of the production's kind, populations, stages,
 * and graph. Requiring both is what keeps a host seed inside an ordinary Node
 * package from resolving to that package and having production state written
 * underneath it.
 *
 * Neither marker is a place a decision could hide. `automovie.config.ts` was
 * the second marker until the delivery decisions it carried moved onto the
 * production design record they always belonged to, and there is no file left
 * whose only job is to be found.
 *
 * `automovie/manifest.json` used to stand in for either of them. It no longer
 * does: that path is the legacy v1 layout, which is import input rather than a
 * shape any current project is asked to carry, so discovery must not depend on
 * a state tree existing before the project can be opened.
