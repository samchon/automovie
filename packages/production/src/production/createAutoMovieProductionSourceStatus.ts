/**
 * Open the read-only source gate status one project's checks share.
 *
 * Capture, receipt reopen, guarded commits, inspection and repaint all ask the
 * same question of the same project handle: does current source still pass the
 * read-only gate, and under which input identity. This composes the answer
 * from a fresh snapshot read through that handle, the builder's own gate run,
 * the builder's generated-root walk and the process module cache, and retains
 * a successful answer only while a fresh snapshot proves it unchanged.
 *
 * The snapshot is judged against the authoring evidence a compile would read
 * now: the live reader when one is supplied, otherwise the fixed declaration.
 * The builder carries its own evidence, so a caller that must compile with
 * freshly read evidence supplies a builder that reads it on every run.
 *
 * Runtime observations belong to the host that executed that builder. The
 * default reads Node's module cache and physically lists the generated root.
 * A host with its own loader supplies the same complete observations through
 * the named runtime port; it must include every generated entry and every
 * loaded module. The port changes neither snapshot comparison nor refusal.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/agent-authoring/source-owned-loop.md#agent-narrowest-valid-check Gives every capture, receipt and publication check of one project a gate status that executes authored source only when its inputs moved.
 * @evidence specifications/authoring-and-authority/source-authority-and-derivation.md#spec-authoring-source-derivation-state Serves a gate answer as current only while a freshly read snapshot equals the one it referenced.
