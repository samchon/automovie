/**
 * Collect the owner registrations one evaluated library module carries.
 *
 * Module evaluation is the only step that needs Node's loader, so it arrives as
 * `load` and runs inside the same failure boundary as every build call. What
 * this owns is everything after evaluation: discovering each export that names
 * a `design`, refusing an address the authoring declaration does not own,
 * admitting the exact graph-selected owner edge before anything runs, and
 * obtaining the contribution either from `build(context)` or, for a
 * precomputed owner, from its selected derived artifact through the shared
 * structured JSON ingress. Both forms then meet the same contribution schema
 * and branch rules.
 *
 * A refusal names the input that has to change. An executed owner's schema or
 * branch refusal points at its source file. A precomputed owner's points at the
 * derived artifact, because the correction belongs to that artifact's generator
 * rather than to anything the source returned.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/agent-authoring/source-owned-loop.md#agent-source-result-link Registers each contribution under the exact source path, export and design address whose owner edge was admitted, and attributes each refusal to that export or to the artifact it selected.
 * @evidence specifications/authoring-and-authority/source-authority-and-derivation.md#spec-authoring-derivation-output-lineage Admits the graph-selected path, export and Markdown target as one owner edge before invoking build or reading a derived contribution, and refuses an export whose runtime claim names another owner.
