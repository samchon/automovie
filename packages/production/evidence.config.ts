/**
 * Every authored production declaration joins the repository contract graph.
 *
 * The barrel is the only source exclusion because it re-exports declarations
 * whose defining symbols already carry their own contract evidence.
 *
 * Joining is selection, not obligation: a source that implements no listed
 * target owes nothing and stays silent, while every H3 unit of an admitted
 * document must be answered by a truthful citation or, when no production
 * export implements it, by an exclusion in the package ledger that names the
 * boundary. The document population below is curated by the contracts the
 * production library actually implements rather than by the whole corpus, so
 * admitting a document is a decision to answer for all of its units.
