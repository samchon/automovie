 * model's bindings first (an `AutoMovieTextureCache` primes them in one pass)
 * and hands over an {@link IAutoMovieTextureResolver} that answers
 * synchronously. Omitting it builds every material with its scalar coefficients
 * and no maps, which is exactly what a model declaring no texture renders and
 * what every pre-texture production still renders. The resolver must answer
 * with a texture object PER BINDING, because {@link buildMaterial} writes that
 * binding's color space, UV transform and sampler onto whatever it is given,
