 * {@link buildMaterial} writes a binding's color space, UV transform and sampler
 * ONTO the texture object it is given, so two slots that name the same image
 * must not receive the same object: a floor repeating its tile 40 times and a
 * table top repeating the same tile twice would otherwise fight over one
 * `repeat`, last writer winning. But decoding that image twice is a second
 * download and a second GPU upload of identical pixels, per model, for a
 * building whose whole point is that the same tile recurs everywhere.
 *
 * So the asset is decoded once and each binding gets `clone()` of it. A
 * `three.js` clone shares its source's `Source` object, which is what the
 * renderer keys its GPU upload on, so N clones of one asset are N cheap
 * descriptors over ONE upload while each keeps its own sampling state.
 *
 * The cache is per shot rather than per model because a shot is the lifetime a
 * host can actually end: {@link dispose} releases every clone it issued and
 * every source it decoded, exactly once however many times it is called, and a
 * cache that has been disposed refuses further work rather than quietly
 * decoding into a bucket nobody will empty.
