/**
 * Where one member stands in its cycle, in `[0, 1)`.
 *
 * Phase is the slot's compiled `motionPhase`, derived from the formation seed
 * and the slot index, so the member that leads the stride leads it on every
 * machine and in every run. What is added to it is the ground its unit has
 * covered, expressed in cycles. No clock is read, and nothing accumulates
 * between frames: the same cues at the same time always resolve to the same
 * point of the cycle, which is what makes a re-render byte-identical.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/formations/reform-and-group-motion.md#formation-turn-speed-response Applies the formation's resolved turn and speed response here.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/formation-motion-resolution-and-budgets.md#performance-formation-determinism-status-compatibility Materializes that response in the group-motion cycle state.
