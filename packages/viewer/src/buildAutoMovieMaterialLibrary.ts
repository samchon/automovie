/**
 * Build the exact model material identities requested by simulated surfaces.
 *
 * Model parts cite materials inside one model, but water, soft furnishing, and
 * planting records cite only a material id. Such a citation therefore resolves
 * across the compiled model population and must have exactly one definition.
 * Repeated declarations are one definition only when their complete records are
 * structurally equal. Missing and conflicting declarations are refused before
 * any material is built, so model order can never decide a visible result.
 *
 * Each admitted id is built once and shared by every borrowing surface. Texture
 * assets are primed through the shot cache before synchronous material
 * construction; that cache owns binding-private texture clones and decoded
 * sources, while the returned library owns only the `THREE.Material` objects.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/rendering/materials-lighting-and-color.md#rendering-material-resolution Resolves named simulated-surface bindings through the same PBR construction and texture path as model parts.
 * @evidence specifications/editorial-render-and-delivery/render-products-visibility-and-color.md#spec-render-material-color Refuses ambiguous or absent material identity and creates one deterministic runtime material per admitted id.
 * @evidence requirements/rendering/scene-lowering-and-runtime-state.md#rendering-lowering-ownership Assigns derived material and texture resources to explicit shot-lifetime owners.
 * @evidence specifications/editorial-render-and-delivery/render-schedule-state-and-headless.md#spec-render-state-isolation Keeps material lowering and disposal isolated to one runtime.
