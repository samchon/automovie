/**
 * Apply a {@link IAutoMoviePose} to a built model by running the engine's
 * forward kinematics and writing each bone's local rotation onto the
 * corresponding `THREE.Bone`. The pose's root transform (if any) is applied to
 * the model root.
 *
 * The engine owns the math (semantic angles → quaternions), so the viewer only
 * copies results onto `three.js` objects, keeping rendering a thin, swappable
 * layer over the deterministic core.
 *
 * `restFrames` optionally reads each joint angle as **clinical** and maps it
 * into the rig's rest-relative space before articulating (e.g. abduction 180
 * raises either arm overhead regardless of side); omit it to treat the pose's
 * angles as raw rig-space, the historical behaviour.
 *
 * Returns the skeleton bones the FK resolved but the model's bone map does not
 * carry (#1051). A deliberately partial imported map (a VRM without toes)
 * reports its unmapped bones every call: the host compares against what it
 * MEANT to map, so a typo in the bone map is distinguishable from an
 * intentional gap instead of both silently not articulating.
 *
 * @evidence requirements/motion/root-motion-and-trajectories.md#motion-root-authority-mode Preserves the resolved pose root as this surface's transform authority.
 * @evidence specifications/performance-motion-and-staging/rig-deformation-and-retargeting.md#performance-rig-skin-rigid-morph-deformation Implements the package-independent root-trajectory authority boundary.
