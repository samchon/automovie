 * @evidenceExclude requirements/agent-authoring/project-ownership.md#agent-editable-source-authority Rendering produces bytes in memory; which of them a project may then edit is decided by the project that receives them, not here.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/agent-authoring/project-ownership.md#agent-repository-project-boundary The boundary between reusable capability and one work's facts is drawn by the packages a rendered project depends on, not by the act of rendering the template.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/agent-authoring/project-ownership.md#agent-project-owned-bytes The template ships no production image, audio, model, or motion assets; their acquisition and ownership belong to the authored project.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/agent-authoring/project-ownership.md#agent-authoring-tool-replaceability Tool replaceability is a property of the rendered project's dependencies and public contracts, which rendering copies rather than decides.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/agent-authoring/project-ownership.md#agent-ambiguous-ownership-refusal The template carries no authored production assets whose source, license, or digest it could adjudicate.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/capability-and-content-boundary.md#spec-authoring-system-project-responsibility The split of system and project responsibility is stated by the contracts the template ships, not performed by rendering them.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/capability-and-content-boundary.md#spec-authoring-capability-state Capability state belongs to the packages a project installs; rendering emits the same bytes whatever those packages can currently do.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/capability-and-content-boundary.md#spec-authoring-capability-not-content-invariant The invariant is held by what the template contains, which is a harness and no production content; rendering copies that set without deciding it.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/capability-and-content-boundary.md#spec-authoring-capability-failure-gap Rendering template bytes does not diagnose a production implementation or classify its runtime capability.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/source-authority-and-derivation.md#spec-authoring-source-derivation-state Rendering has no production derivation state beyond the scaffold bytes it returns.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/source-authority-and-derivation.md#spec-authoring-source-ownership-failure Ownership failures belong to an actual source or file publication boundary; this renderer only returns candidate bytes.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/source-authority-and-derivation.md#spec-authoring-source-resume-compatibility Rendering is one in-memory operation with no persisted execution to resume.
 * @evidenceExclude requirements/agent-authoring/project-ownership.md#agent-sandbox-write-boundary Scaffold rendering returns bytes and does not own a repository experiment root or approve sandbox packing and installation.
 * @evidenceExclude specifications/authoring-and-authority/source-authority-and-derivation.md#spec-authoring-sandbox-physical-ownership Rendering template bytes selects no repository experiment root and performs no package packing or installation.
