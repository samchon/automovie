/**
 * Serialize an {@link IAutoMovieScript} into the deterministic, human-readable
 * plain-text screenplay: the artifact a person reviews and edits, exported
 * alongside the guide video (D009: dialogue TEXT is authoring data; audio is
 * diffusion's).
 *
 * **Convention** (plain text, fixed indents, no trailing whitespace):
 *
 * - Header: `LOGLINE: …` and `THEME: …`, from the intent root when a tree is
 *   present (the tree is the authored truth), else from the flat script.
 * - Act: a blank-line-separated `ACT, <purpose>` rule.
 * - Scene: the screenplay slug `INT. LOCATION - TIMEOFDAY` (location and time
 *   upper-cased), followed by the optional description line.
 * - Group: the rationale bracketed as `[<rationale>]`.
 * - Beat: the beat's flat name as `BEAT, <name>`, the stage direction prose, each
 *   dialogue line as a 16-space-indented `SPEAKER` line over an
 *   8-space-indented text line (prefixed `[t=…s]` when anchored), and the shot
 *   caption bracketed as `[Shot: …]`.
 *
 * **Tree vs flat.** With `script.tree` the document walks the refinement tree
 * depth-first, children in declaration order (the tree already validated on
 * commit: one intent root, acyclic, beats joined 1:1). Without a tree the
 * fallback renders the header plus each flat beat as `BEAT, <name>` over its
 * summary. Treeless scripts stay exportable. A script with no beats at all
 * throws: there is no screenplay to render, and serializing an empty shell
 * would hide the authoring gap.
 *
 * Same script → same bytes: iteration follows declaration order everywhere and
 * no timestamps or randomness enter the text.
