/**
 * Serialize an {@link IAutoMovieModel} AST into a binary glTF (`.glb`) byte
 * buffer: the **export** half of automovie's glTF round-trip (ingest is the
 * import half).
 *
 * The model's skeleton becomes a glTF node hierarchy (one node per bone, parent
 * links preserved, rest transforms intact). Each part is tessellated (a
 * primitive through the engine's {@link tessellate}, a mesh passed through) and
 * attached as a mesh node: a rigid part is parented to its `attachedBone` node
 * so the exported file articulates by rotating those bone nodes (no skinning
 * needed), everything else sits at the scene root. Materials map onto glTF's
 * metallic-roughness model, which {@link IAutoMovieMaterial} already mirrors.
 *
 * The result is a self-contained `.glb` (geometry embedded in one buffer) that
 * any glTF viewer, or automovie's own ingest, can load. Geometry that the
 * engine only approximates (a capsule tessellates to its bounding cylinder)
 * exports at that fidelity.
 *
 * **Fidelity reductions against the live viewer (#1088).** A skinned mesh part
 * (`attachedBone: null` with `skin` data) exports as a STATIC mesh (no
 * `JOINTS_0`/`WEIGHTS_0`, no glTF skin), so it renders at its rest shape in
 * external viewers; only rigid `attachedBone` parts articulate in the export. A
 * mesh without authored normals exports SMOOTH vertex normals when indexed (the
 * same area-weighted computation the viewer's `computeVertexNormals` performs);
 * a non-indexed triangle soup omits `NORMAL`, and glTF's mandated flat shading
 * equals what the viewer computes for a soup anyway.

 * @evidenceExclude specifications/asset-and-representation/facial-authoring/contract.md#face-spec-connected-basis This serializer consumes an evaluated model; connected facial basis admission, numerical editing and common-normal construction precede serialization in the human builder.
