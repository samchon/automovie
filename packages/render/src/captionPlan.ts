/**
 * Plan the caption sidecar: lay the cut onto the output clock
 * ({@link sequenceTimeline}, the same frame-atomic arithmetic the render and
 * chunk plans use), resolve which shot is LIVE at every output frame
 * (transitions hand the frame to the incoming shot, exactly as playback does),
 * group consecutive frames of one shot into spans, and join each span's beat
 * (`shot.id = "shot:" + beat`; an unprefixed id passes through as the beat id)
 * to the screenplay tree's beat node for the caption and the enclosing scene's
 * slug. Treeless scripts caption every span `null`. The sidecar still carries
 * the frame→beat map.
 *
 * Planning only: the host writes the file ({@link renderCaptionSidecar}).
 *
 * @evidence requirements/delivery-and-accessibility/captions-subtitles-and-cues.md#delivery-cue-freshness `planCaptionSidecar` preserves deterministic cue-to-frame mapping in the timed-text sidecar.
 * @evidence specifications/editorial-render-and-delivery/delivery-audio-text-and-localization.md#spec-delivery-caption-cues `planCaptionSidecar` exposes that responsibility through the package-independent system contract.
 * @evidence requirements/rendering/frame-schedules-and-sampling.md#rendering-frame-boundary-convention Uses start-inclusive, end-exclusive frame spans on the render clock.
 * @evidence requirements/rendering/frame-schedules-and-sampling.md#rendering-frame-number-time Resolves each output frame at its deterministic global sample time.
 * @evidence specifications/editorial-render-and-delivery/render-schedule-state-and-headless.md#spec-render-frame-schedule Applies the same frame schedule and direct-seek convention as sequence rendering.
