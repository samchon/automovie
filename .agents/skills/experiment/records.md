# Recording A Benchmark Campaign

Read this document before launching a benchmark or comparison campaign. It owns the durable record, causal claim, judgment, and operation protocol. [briefing.md](briefing.md) owns what the writer sees, [steering.md](steering.md) owns live-session mechanics, and [comparison.md](comparison.md) owns several units under one harness.

Start from the repository's [experiment campaign issue template](../../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/experiment-campaign.md). The issue is the self-contained launch contract and durable conclusion. Live operational notes may stay in `.wiki`, generated evidence stays with its production, and measurements that must outlive a deleted sandbox belong in the issue. Chat history and private notes are never the only carrier of a run fact.

## Reconcile The Operative Handoff

Before a new run, reconcile its issue body with the selected repository head and the canonical procedures it names. Read sandbox creation and refresh through [the experiment router](SKILL.md#create-the-sandbox), session identity through [steering](steering.md), and authoring, commands, and capture prerequisites through the generated project's own instructions and manifest. A copied command or contract in an old issue is not an alternative owner. Correct the operative body and record the correction in a comment while preserving the user-selected subject, model and driver, input references, and launch-authorization boundary. Reconcile procedural role assignments with [judgment separation](briefing.md#keep-the-roles-apart), rather than preserving a stale assignment that makes the commissioner its own judge.

A resumed frozen run still belongs to its recorded harness, not to today's repository. Read its pinned instructions and preserve its earlier observations. Adopting a changed harness creates a successor under [the run state machine](#operate-one-frozen-run-as-a-state-machine); updating an issue never upgrades an old run's calibration, actual provenance, or result.

Fill the current campaign template before a new launch. An inherited proposal with missing fields is a proposal to complete, not a ready run. Keep unsupported actual values `unverified` with their reasons, and use [the record matrix](#validate-the-record-before-launch-and-close) to decide readiness. Correcting the handoff grants no permission to launch.

## Freeze Identity Before Launch

Give the campaign, every subject, condition, experimental unit, run, record, and receipt a stable id. A run records one `subjectId`, one `conditionId`, and one `replicateId`; the replicate id is unique inside that subject and condition. A different subject is a different experimental unit, not another replicate of the same condition.

Freeze and digest the brief, repository head, packed package set, harness and skill revisions, model, reasoning effort, tool versions, policy, working and readable roots, network mode, input bytes, outcome rubric, observation plan, and planned runtime and resource envelope. Record the actual model, effort, tools, roots, network behavior, elapsed time, and resource use beside the plan. An unsupported or unreadable actual value is `unverified` with the reason, never a copy of the plan.

Use `disabled`, `controlled`, or `open` as the retrieval mode. A controlled or open run declares allowed and denied domains, exposure limits, and the information the writer must not receive. Each retrieval receipt carries a sanitized query, resulting URL, timestamp, actor, purpose, and disposition. Record no credential value or credential key name.

Retain only observable trajectory material: user and assistant messages, visible tool calls and results, timestamps, and process outcomes. The trajectory manifest records the source, format version, byte length, digest, first and last timestamp, storage location, retention period, access boundary, redactions, and privacy disposition. Hidden reasoning is excluded. A copied or redacted trajectory gets a transfer receipt that binds source and destination digests and states every transformation.

Run preflight against the exact launch paths and runtime. On Windows, record whether legacy `MAX_PATH` or long-path-aware behavior applies, the effective path limit, the longest resolved sandbox, temporary, artifact, and session path, and the remaining headroom; refuse launch when the harness cannot prove that every planned path fits. Record the readable root and what it exposes rather than requiring it to exclude this repository: a sandbox lives under `experimental/`, so the repository and its history are readable by construction and blindness to being in an experiment is spent before the first turn.

## Declare The Causal Ceiling

A repetition under one condition measures consistency and variability under that condition. It does not identify whether the writer, brief, model, harness, or product caused the result. Use this matrix to set the strongest allowed disposition before reading the outcome.

| Design | Allowed disposition | Claim ceiling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One subject, one condition, one run | `exploratory` or `provisional` | One observation and a follow-up hypothesis |
| One subject, one condition, independent repeated runs | `consistency-only` or `variability-found` | Agreement or variation within the observed condition, with uncertainty |
| Different subjects under one harness | `exploratory` | Breadth observations for the named subjects |
| Several productions without a comparator | `exploratory` | Cross-work patterns and follow-up hypotheses |
| One subject, a predeclared comparator, independent repetition in both conditions, and exactly one changed axis | `controlled-comparison` | The named contrast on the named subject |
| Unclear condition identity, outcome rubric, or judge calibration | `inconclusive` | No causal or aggregate score claim |

A controlled comparison names exactly one `changedAxis` and freezes the remaining `invariantBasis`. Any uncontrolled difference is a limitation and lowers the claim ceiling. Never generalize the contrast to an unobserved axis or subject population.

The disposition is part of the result record, not an inference from the design row. Record exactly one of `exploratory`, `provisional`, `consistency-only`, `variability-found`, `controlled-comparison`, or `inconclusive` for every terminal run or comparison and verify that it does not exceed the predeclared ceiling.

There is no global sample size or metric. State why the chosen repetition is enough for this question, outcome shape, expected heterogeneity, cost, and failure risk. Two runs remain the minimum reproduction probe for a universal claim, not proof of a cause. `pass^k` is available only for repeated exact binary endpoints under one task and condition; it never replaces a structural, visual, or narrative rubric.

Keep writer variance and judge variance separate. A changed writer artifact and a changed verdict on the same artifact are different observations and are aggregated only after immutable condition identity and a calibrated rubric bind both.

## Calibrate Judgment Before Production Review

Freeze a calibration corpus with qualified-human truth, including at least one passing artifact, one known failure, one ambiguous or high-impact case, and one pair whose presentation order can be reversed. Cover more than one claim and artifact topology so a narrow population cannot masquerade as general calibration. Record rubric shape and language, the first and reversed order, the reviewer verdict and reason for each presentation, human agreement, false PASS and false FAIL results, and every known blind spot.

A separated reviewer using the same model family is still useful, but separation is not calibration and does not erase self-preference or order sensitivity. A known failed artifact that the reviewer passes makes the affected rubric axis uncalibrated. Do not average that disagreement away or promote a production result on that axis to PASS.

Missing calibration, a missing outcome rubric, or a reviewer who overlaps the writer or commissioner makes `ready` and `gate-review` invalid. Preserve an already-run incomplete record as `inconclusive`; do not repair its authority after the outcome is known. An order-reversal witness uses an independent reviewer or session, or a counterbalancing order frozen before either presentation, so memory of the first result is not called a blind reversal.

The reviewer derives its verdict from the frozen corpus independently of the writer and commissioner. Every gate verdict is `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `INCONCLUSIVE`. `FAIL` names the rubric claim, observed evidence, affected artifact and stage, reason, and next action. Audit the evidence topology and claim population before judging content. An empty `claims: []`, a topology the reviewer did not inspect, or a machine-invisible defect is recorded explicitly rather than treated as no finding.

`INCONCLUSIVE` leaves the submitted gate unpassed and records the uncertainty and evidence needed to settle it. It is neither permission to advance nor a content repair verdict. Route it through the predeclared escalation; if it cannot be settled on the frozen basis, retain the limitation and follow the run state machine instead of manufacturing a PASS.

Predeclare escalation. An ambiguous or high-impact judgment, an order-sensitive result, a known blind-spot match, or disagreement with qualified-human truth goes to a reviewer from a different model family or a qualified human. The record names who decided, what evidence they saw, their reason, and which earlier verdict the decision supersedes. Escalation narrows uncertainty; it never rewrites the earlier observation.

## Operate One Frozen Run As A State Machine

One run starts at `declared` and ends in exactly one terminal state: `completed`, `failed`, `interrupted`, or `abandoned`. The allowed edges are `declared -> preflight | abandoned`, `preflight -> ready | failed | abandoned`, `ready -> running | failed | abandoned`, `running -> gate-review | failed | interrupted | abandoned`, and `gate-review -> running | completed | failed | interrupted | abandoned`. Reaching `completed` therefore requires a recorded judgment gate. A stage, condition, or immutable basis never changes in place; changing one creates a successor run with a new id and an explicit predecessor link.

Each transition receipt records its id, a monotonic sequence, run id and generation, from and to states, timestamp, actor, reason, evidence identities, and result. A transition is invalid when it uses an edge not listed above, follows a terminal state, changes the frozen basis, or has no receipt. A replacement generation never covers, edits, or deletes the interrupted generation's record.

The observer samples every active unit on a predeclared cadence and timer. Each liveness receipt records its id and monotonic sequence, the process identity and creation time, transcript growth, artifact signal chosen from the turn's requested deliverable, last progress time, timer deadline, and one disposition: `alive`, `idle`, `stalled`, `finished`, or `unknown`. An out-of-order sample or timer expiry without a recorded disposition is an operational failure. Writer self-report and a wrapper notification are observations, not terminal evidence.

Create an intervention receipt before acting. It names the run and generation, owner, timestamp, evidence, reason, intended action, affected process or artifact identities, and recovery boundary. Close it afterwards with the exact action, result, terminal or successor state, process exit evidence, preserved artifacts, and cleanup result. A silent kill, restart, stage mutation, or replacement is invalid even when the replacement succeeds.

Only the coordinator changes lifecycle state. Before a replacement, mark the old generation `interrupted` or `failed`, close its intervention, and issue a notice that names what the successor inherits and what it must re-establish. Never backcast evidence from the successor into its predecessor.

The close audit lists every launched process, session, sandbox, temporary path, external registration, receipt, unresolved timer, and preserved artifact. It proves that every run is terminal, every intervention is closed, every retained record has a privacy disposition, and every owned process and temporary resource is removed or transferred to a named owner. A leaked process, missing replacement receipt, partial transfer, or unresolved timer prevents campaign closure.

## Validate The Record Before Launch And Close

Use this synthetic matrix against the filled issue and records. It is a manual contract check, not a source-text or repository-shape test.

| Probe | Expected result |
| --- | --- |
| One subject and condition with two unique replicate ids, identical frozen basis, and a `consistency-only` conclusion | Valid |
| Different subject ids counted as one replicate group | Invalid |
| A causal product, brief, model, or writer claim without a comparator | Invalid |
| A controlled comparison with two changed axes or no repetition in one condition | Invalid |
| One exploratory run with its limitation and follow-up observation | Valid |
| A fixed global `N` or mandatory binary metric for visual judgment | Invalid |
| A known failed calibration artifact passed without disagreement and escalation | Invalid |
| An order-sensitive or human-disagreeing verdict retained with both observations and a linked alternate-family or qualified-human escalation | Valid |
| An empty `claims: []` or single-topology calibration reported as full rubric coverage | Invalid |
| A FAIL without claim, evidence, reason, or next action | Invalid |
| An INCONCLUSIVE gate retained with its uncertainty and recorded escalation, without advancing the submitted stage | Valid |
| An INCONCLUSIVE gate treated as PASS or as an unsupported writer repair request | Invalid |
| A stale launch issue corrected before a new run, with prior frozen records and the launch-authorization boundary preserved | Valid |
| A resumed run silently adopting today's harness or missing actual values copied from its plan | Invalid |
| A retrieval-enabled run without policy and sanitized receipts | Invalid |
| A trajectory digest without retention, privacy, or hidden-reasoning exclusion | Invalid |
| Planned values copied into missing actual fields | Invalid |
| A run launched before preflight or a replacement that overwrites its predecessor | Invalid |
| An out-of-order liveness sample or timer expiry without a disposition | Invalid |
| An intervention recorded only after the action or left without its closing half | Invalid |
| A replacement without an interrupted predecessor and replacement notice | Invalid |
| A planned path that exceeds the recorded effective path limit | Invalid |
| A launched process without a final disposition or cleanup/transfer owner | Invalid |
| A completed run with all transition, judgment, transfer, and close-audit receipts linked | Valid |

Open every link, recalculate every digest and count from its named artifact, and read the record as a self-contained handoff. A field that cannot be verified is marked `unverified` with its reason. Do not repair a missing observation by inventing a value after the run.
