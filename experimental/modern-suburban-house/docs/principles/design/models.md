# Model design principles

Model documents specify the deterministic blocking representation that source code must construct. They neither redefine the subject's in-world identity nor prescribe changes over time.

## Representation contract {#representation-contract}

Every model H2 names the geometry result, hierarchy, reusable parts, and proxy status used for the represented owner in that unit. It states silhouette-critical sections, intended open and closed boundaries, negative spaces, component connectivity, stable part and surface ownership, required normals, UVs or deformation data, and the occupied bounds its consumers depend on, only where the represented subject and promised observations require them. It applies the population's representation ceiling by naming the observations the proxy can and cannot support. When adjoining visible sides need different downstream responses, it gives them separate stable surface owners; the materials layer chooses their construction and appearance.

Review question: can an implementer choose an operation and build the intended blocking representation without inventing topology, attributes, part ownership, bounds, or a stronger fidelity claim?

This item owns the required geometry result. Source authoring owns which documented operation realizes it and the consequences that operation preserves, regenerates, omits, or refuses.

## Spatial convention {#spatial-convention}

Every model H2 states its local origin, any forward or up axis that differs from repository convention, occupied extents, and every pivot or fixed placement offset its representation uses. It derives local dimensions from the population's nominated scale reference; primitive defaults never become dimensions by accident. This principle owns the numeric placement of an already named pivot, while the articulation obligation separately decides whether that pivot is a motion-writable interface.

Review question: can the representation be placed, scaled, and compared without discovering a hidden coordinate convention in code?

## Reviewable structure {#reviewable-structure}

Every model H2 identifies its review-critical silhouette, surface partition, and articulation region that the population's neutral model-review set must expose. It does not choose the bound material, shot composition, or dramatic lighting.

Review question: which fixed views and visible boundaries would falsify the model before it is used in motion or a shot?

## Observable style basis {#model-observable-style-basis}

A style, era, genre, or reference label names the observable silhouette, proportion, construction, surface partition, and abstraction decisions it constrains. A label inferred from a filename, mood word, or familiar asset category cannot substitute for those decisions, and this model does not claim camera, lighting, or finish choices owned downstream.

Review question: which observable model decision would falsify the declared style or reference label, and which tempting inference belongs to another owner?

## Scale and layer completion {#model-scale-layer-completion}

A model H2 is semantically complete only when its reference scale, occupied layers, hierarchy, stable interfaces, visible boundaries, proxy limits, and review observations jointly determine the promised blocking representation. A parseable mesh recipe or valid hierarchy is not complete when an implementer must invent a missing layer, scale relation, or visible owner.

Review question: which formally valid representation still lacks the scale, layer, boundary, or observation needed to satisfy its declared use?
