# Space design principles

Space documents define where bodies may exist and move: world, site, building, exterior, interior, room, zone, boundary, opening, and route. They do not own the mesh used to depict an object, its finish, or a timed traversal.

## Topology before geometry {#space-topology}

Every space H2 states its applicable containment, adjacency, connection, obstruction, access, and inside/outside relations before choosing implementation geometry.

Review question: can an implementer recover the complete place graph without reverse-engineering meshes?

## Canonical boundary authority {#space-boundary-authority}

Every spatial relation, dimension, datum, and boundary stated or consumed by the current H2 has one canonical owner. The unit cites a fact owned elsewhere and states only its local consequence; it does not restate, remeasure, or silently override the shared fact.

Review question: which spatial value or relation in this H2 is authored twice, or consumed without an addressable owner?

## Verification-addressable spatial claims {#space-verification-address}

Every consequential spatial claim in the current H2 identifies the observable relation, measurement, tolerance, or route result that could falsify it and points to the population review role that will test it. This unit maps its own claims; the space obligations define the complete shared review set.

Review question: which claim could fail in a plan, section, measurement, or traversal while every observation named by this H2 still passes?
