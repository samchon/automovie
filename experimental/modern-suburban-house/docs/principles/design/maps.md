# Map design principles

Map documents author the broad world in which sites, buildings, subjects, and events are placed. They own terrain, water, ecology, land use, settlement, transport, infrastructure, weather, and time-varying world state at their declared extent; space documents own the site and building topology inside an adopted site boundary.

## Addressable world identity {#map-addressable-world-identity}

Every map H2 owns one independently changeable world feature, relation, state, or observation and gives each feature it states or consumes a stable identity. It cites a feature owned elsewhere rather than copying its geometry or state, and it records the lineage of a split, merge, replacement, or derived representation that would otherwise break that identity.

Review question: which world feature or state in this unit cannot be cited, changed, or followed into a derived view without relying on a label, draw order, or accidental source path?

This item owns one current unit's identity and authority. The map addressability obligation owns complete decomposition across the H2 population.

## Coordinate, extent, and scale convention {#map-coordinate-extent-scale}

Every map H2 states the horizontal, vertical, and temporal reference it uses, its units and declared extent, and the scale or detail at which its claims remain valid. A local frame names its transform to the canonical map frame. A simplified, tiled, instanced, or proxy representation preserves the identities, boundaries, routes, quantities, and states the unit authorizes and does not silently turn missing or low-confidence source data into exact world fact.

Review question: could this unit move, change scale, cross a tile or detail boundary, or be sampled at another time without changing the world fact it claims to preserve?

## Verification-addressable world claims {#map-verification-address}

Every consequential map claim in the current H2 identifies the resolved view, section, route, network query, state comparison, quantity, boundary check, or source comparison that could falsify it and points to the population review role that will test it. This unit maps its own claims; the map obligations define the complete shared review set.

Review question: which terrain, water, network, population, placement, temporal, or delivery claim could fail while every observation named by this H2 still passes?
