# System-source upstream revision

What implementing a reviewed system unit proves wrong in that design or the interfaces it consumes, and what is repaired there. Every selected system-source export answers for the system unit it realizes.

## Design revision from system-source work {#design-revision-from-system-source-work}

Implementation tests whether system design fixes inputs, owned outputs, clocks, ordering, budgets, degradation, failures, and recovery without hidden state. Report any dependency, write authority, evaluation order, fallback, or boundary behavior the export could not implement without choosing locally. Repair the system or earliest consumed design owner; ambient runtime order and silent fallback do not become authored process rules.

`@evidence` names every upstream target repaired and the interaction or failure case that exposed it. When the export exposes no defect, `@evidenceExclude` names its system parent and the concrete interfaces, clocks, ordering, budgets, and failure behavior implemented as written. A parentless export or generic integration claim covers nothing.

Review question: what did implementing this system-source export prove wrong in its actual system or earlier parents, or which concrete parent decisions did it test and find sufficient?
