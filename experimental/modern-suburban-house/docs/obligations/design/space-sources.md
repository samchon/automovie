# Space source obligations

These obligations divide the work of turning reviewed topology into stable engine-facing records across the selected space-source population without making source a second spatial author.

## Design-owned topology {#space-source-design-ownership}

Every exported owner realizes one reviewed space document and introduces no unreviewed place, boundary, opening, route, dimension, or access rule.

Review question: can every emitted spatial fact be traced to exactly one reviewed H2?

## Stable spatial identities {#space-source-stable-identities}

Every emitted space, surface, opening, level, zone, and route keeps stable ids, frames, units, bounds, and parent relationships across repeated builds.

Review question: do equal inputs emit identical identities, frames, topology, and dimensions?

## Invalid topology is refused {#space-source-invalid-topology}

Cycles, missing hosts, contradictory bounds, blocked required routes, and exterior/interior mismatches produce explicit diagnostics rather than repaired or guessed geometry.

Review question: does each invalid topology case fail with its exact owner and cause?
