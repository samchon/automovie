# System obligations

These roles are distributed across lighting, environment, effects, simulation, sound, service, and other system-design H2s. A system owns coupled process behavior, not the map, model, space, material, instance, or motion fact it consumes. Narrative or brief prose owns audience meaning, and shot source owns its timed realization.

## Addressable system decisions {#addressable-system-decisions}

The system population gives every independently enabled, parameterized, ordered, budgeted, or reviewable process one stable H2.

Review question: which process can fail or change alone and therefore still needs a separate owner?

## Ownership and interfaces {#system-ownership-interfaces}

The population names each system's inputs, outputs, dependencies, affected owners, authority, and ordering relative to other systems.

Review question: which state can two systems both write, or which required input has no authoritative owner?

## State, clock, and determinism {#system-state-clock}

The population defines initial state, clock, sampling, seed, update order, checkpoint/seek behavior, and terminal state for every time-varying system.

Review question: can an arbitrary requested time be reproduced without hidden history or an unrecorded random choice?

## Budget and degradation {#system-budget-degradation}

The population allocates bounded work, admission limits, representation tiers, fallbacks, and explicit refusal when the requested result exceeds the prototype ceiling.

Review question: what exact limit changes fidelity, omits work, or refuses the request, and is that consequence visible?

## System review set {#system-review-set}

The population defines finite state, interaction, stress, failure, and observation cases that distinguish correct system behavior from a successful render call.

Review question: which reproducible case falsifies each interface, temporal, and budget promise?
