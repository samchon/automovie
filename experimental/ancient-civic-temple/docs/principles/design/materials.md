# Material design principles

Material documents define construction, finish, scale, response, and state. They bind to stable surfaces owned by models or spaces and do not redefine those surfaces.

## Construction and appearance separation {#material-construction-appearance}

Every material H2 distinguishes its physical layer or assembly facts from renderer-facing appearance parameters and states the deliberate relationship between them.

Review question: which visual setting is being presented as construction truth, or which construction promise has no visible proxy?

## Binding interface contract {#material-binding-interface}

Every material H2 names the stable surface vocabulary, orientation, coordinate convention, and compatibility conditions it requires without redefining host geometry or assigning a surface owned by another material document. Concrete assignments remain population roles under the material obligations.

Review question: can a model or space owner determine whether this material is compatible without surrendering geometry ownership or guessing a coordinate convention?

## Verification-addressable material claims {#material-verification-address}

Every consequential construction, scale, junction, response, and state claim in the current H2 identifies the observable sample that could falsify it and points to the population review role that will test it. This unit maps its own claims; the material obligations define the complete shared conditions and sample set.

Review question: which material claim could be false while every sample named by this H2 still passes?
