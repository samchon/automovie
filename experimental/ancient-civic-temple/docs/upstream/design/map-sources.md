# Map-source upstream revision

What implementing a reviewed map unit proves wrong in that design or its settings basis, and what is repaired there. Every selected map-source export answers for the map unit it realizes.

## Design revision from map-source work {#design-revision-from-map-source-work}

Implementation tests whether the map design fixes a realizable coordinate basis, feature identity, extent, topology, state, level of detail, and source-resolution rule. Report any exact value, transform, seam behavior, temporal case, or interface the export could not implement without inventing it. Repair the map or earlier settings owner before changing source; a constant, branch, or library default in code is not design authority.

`@evidence` names every upstream target repaired and the implementation decision that exposed it. When the export exposes no defect, `@evidenceExclude` names its map parent and the concrete coordinate, identity, extent, state, and resolution decisions implemented as written. A parentless export or generic "design implemented" answer covers nothing.

Review question: what did implementing this map-source export prove wrong in its actual map or settings parents, or which concrete parent decisions did it test and find sufficient?
