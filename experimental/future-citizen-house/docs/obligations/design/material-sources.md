# Material source obligations

These obligations divide the work of turning reviewed construction and appearance into deterministic renderer-facing records across the selected material-source population without inventing a finish.

## Design-owned material construction {#material-source-design-ownership}

Every exported owner realizes one reviewed material document and introduces no unreviewed finish, layer, surface assignment, scale, or response.

Review question: can every emitted material fact be traced to exactly one reviewed H2?

## Explicit renderer mapping {#material-source-renderer-mapping}

Construction and appearance parameters map explicitly into deterministic renderer values, color spaces, texture transforms, face bindings, and resource identities.

Review question: can each authored parameter be located in the renderer record without inference or a second default?

## Invalid material state is refused {#material-source-invalid-state}

Missing surfaces or textures, invalid ranges, incompatible channels, unsupported states, and budget violations remain named diagnostics rather than silent defaults or substitutions.

Review question: does each invalid material input fail before a renderer can substitute a plausible image?
