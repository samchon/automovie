# Motion design principles

Motion documents specify deterministic change of represented state over time. They consume settings capabilities and whichever reviewed map, model, space, material, instance, or system interface owns the changed property, without redefining any of them.

## State endpoints {#state-endpoints}

Every motion H2 names its complete entry state, exit state, and the properties allowed to change. A hold is an authored interval with identical endpoints, not an absence of specification.

Review question: can a caller determine the exact state before and after the motion without executing it?

## Temporal phases {#temporal-phases}

Every motion H2 applies the production time base to its own duration and phase boundaries, including easing and hold intervals where they affect the observed path. Narrative adverbs do not substitute for a timing function.

Review question: for any production time, can an implementer identify the active phase and its normalized progress?

## Spatial relation {#spatial-relation}

Every motion H2 states its coordinate frame and every path, rotation convention, contact target, or directional relationship that its transition actually uses. Where contact applies, it uses the population's contact measurement policy rather than defining a private tolerance. Contact and direction are measured observations, not adjectives, and an inapplicable relation is not invented merely to fill the checklist.

Review question: which frame and tolerance decide whether the moving parts followed the intended path or maintained contact?

## Parameter domain {#parameter-domain}

Every motion H2 defines its inputs, valid ranges, defaults, compatibility with the population's composition and interruption policy, and response to unsupported values. A reusable motion may vary only the degrees of freedom that its design document exposes.

Review question: can a caller know every accepted variation and every rejected request before calling the implementation?
