# System upstream revision

What coupling processes and state proves wrong in settings or consumed design units, and what is repaired there. Every selected system H2 answers for its actual parents.

## Parent revision from system work {#parent-revision-from-system-work}

System work tests whether interfaces remain coherent under ordering, load, interaction, degradation, and failure. Report the exact parent defect it exposes: an input with no authority, two owners writing one state, an incompatible clock or budget, a design limit that cannot survive the coupled process, or a required fallback with no settings decision. Repair the earliest owning parent; do not resolve the conflict through hidden evaluation order, ambient state, or a system-local override.

`@evidence` names every upstream target repaired and the coupled case that exposed it. When this unit exposes no defect, `@evidenceExclude` names the concrete inputs, owners, clocks, limits, and failure cases examined and why they were sufficient. A parentless unit or generic stability claim covers nothing.

Review question: what did coupling this system unit prove wrong in its actual settings or design parents, or which concrete parent decisions did it test and find sufficient?
