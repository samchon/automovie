# Material-source upstream revision

What implementing a reviewed material unit proves wrong in that design or the surfaces it binds, and what is repaired there. Every selected material-source export answers for the material unit it realizes.

## Design revision from material-source work {#design-revision-from-material-source-work}

Implementation tests whether material design fixes construction, named inputs, coordinate use, response domains, state, and fallback behavior. Report any shader value, image interpretation, surface binding, color-space conversion, or tier rule the export could not implement without choosing locally. Repair the material, model, space, or settings owner before changing source; engine defaults do not become authored appearance.

`@evidence` names every upstream target repaired and the implementation case that exposed it. When the export exposes no defect, `@evidenceExclude` names its material parent and the concrete construction, inputs, bindings, states, and fallbacks implemented as written. A parentless export or generic visual-match claim covers nothing.

Review question: what did implementing this material-source export prove wrong in its actual material or earlier parents, or which concrete parent decisions did it test and find sufficient?
