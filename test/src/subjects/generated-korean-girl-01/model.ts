/**
 * Assemble this one reference face from independently inspectable anatomical
 * builders now shared by the human package. This study retains its own measured
 * basis and configuration rather than loading the portable face-document API.
 * Construction coordinates are millimetres, +Y is up and +Z points out of the
 * face. Anatomical left is +X.
 *
 * The anatomical foundation delegates to the connected prior and recorded fit;
 * the procedural foundation uses the replaceable component protocol below.
 * Their settings are deliberately separate, so a procedural nose parameter
 * cannot silently become an inactive control on the anatomical foundation.
 * The control net owns measurement provenance. Replaceable components supply
 * exact skin attachments; the host adapts surrounding skin and refines their
 * common surface before each component finishes against its actual opening.
 * Every part crosses the same engine-owned metre conversion in portraitPart before becoming AutoMovie
 * model data. Optional coarse hair supports silhouette inspection; detailed
 * hair and torso remain outside this face iteration.
 *
 * The caller chooses components and optional refined-skin layers. Empty layers
 * preserve the subdivided skin. Eye-owned optical materials are collected with
 * the shared palette, while the ear builder samples the final skin in metres.
 * See ../README.md for the tracked export, capture and verification entrypoints.
 *
 * @evidence src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#front Supplies the assembled eyes, nose and dental row inspected from the front.
 * @evidence src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#left-oblique Supplies the nasal projection and left pinna relationship inspected at positive yaw.
 * @evidence src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#right-oblique Supplies the opposite cheek, eye occlusion and mouth depth inspected at negative yaw.
 * @evidence src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#left-profile Supplies the forehead-to-chin silhouette inspected from the anatomical left.
 * @evidence src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#right-profile Supplies the opposite profile and mirrored ear inspected from the anatomical right.
 * @evidence src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#back Supplies the inferred closed rear skull and neck attachment inspected from behind.
 * @evidence src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#top Supplies the cranial and nasal silhouette inspected at steep positive elevation.
 * @evidence src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#bottom Supplies the nasal cavities, chin underside and intentionally open neck crop inspected from below.
 * @evidence src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#rear-oblique Supplies the opposing oblique that exposes the hair curtain and rear attachment relationship.
 * @evidence src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#reference Supplies the geometry compared against the photograph in its recorded camera pose.
 * @evidence src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#clay Supplies the shared surface inspected independently of its material colours.
 * @evidence src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#component-replacement Assembles the component selections exercised by the replacement tests; fresh alternate-assembly captures remain pending for this revision.
 * @evidenceReview src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#front #7c8e313 Reopened the frozen front frame after a byte-identical Node 22 GLB replay: the connected nose retains an angular base, the lower lids form regular bands and the visible crowns remain coarse. No likeness acceptance follows.
 * @evidenceReview src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#left-oblique #580c386 Reopened the positive-yaw frozen frame: the exposed pinna and continuous nasal sidewall remain visible, with a broad cheek-to-mouth depression. Hidden anatomy and eye fitting remain unaccepted.
 * @evidenceReview src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#right-oblique #5a791c9 Reopened the negative-yaw frozen frame: no detached upper nasal crosspiece is visible, the far eye is occluded and the coarse temporal hair overhang dominates.
 * @evidenceReview src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#left-profile #6a3370e Reopened the frozen anatomical-left profile: forehead, nasal, lip and chin silhouettes are continuous without the rejected bridge spikes. Single-view depth inference is not independently verified.
 * @evidenceReview src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#right-profile #c836ccb Reopened the opposing frozen profile: the nasal silhouette remains connected while the curtain hides most of the side head. Coarse lip and crown form does not establish posterior likeness.
 * @evidenceReview src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#back #5c7de2a Reopened the frozen back frame and corrected the observation to retain its visible horizontal cap-to-curtain seam. The tightly framed coarse hair mass is not a reproduced groom.
 * @evidenceReview src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#top #0b45dcc Reopened the frozen overhead frame: the cap is helmet-like and the exposed nasal silhouette has no detached triangular bridge projections. Posterior dimensions remain inferred.
 * @evidenceReview src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#bottom #cd2a6e6 Reopened the frozen underside: two nasal openings and their lining are visible, the cropped neck is open, and the broad chin-to-throat transition and simplified columella remain unaccepted.
 * @evidenceReview src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#rear-oblique #706d696 Reopened the frozen rear oblique and retained its cap-to-curtain seam in the record. No detached ear fragment is visible, while the curtain hides most of the head and cannot establish unseen likeness.
 * @evidenceReview src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#reference #1899ddf Reopened the frozen recorded-pose frame and read the earlier measured oral-fit record. Synthetic lid, nasal and crown forms remain visible; the historical pixel comparisons were not remeasured in this pass.
 * @evidenceReview src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#clay #6263b83 Reopened all three frozen clay frames: connected nasal and cranial surfaces retain angular alar form, broad perioral depressions and raised vermilion. Opaque clay corneas are not a colour-render optical verdict.
 * @evidenceReview src/subjects/generated-korean-girl-01/review.md#component-replacement #91a7335 Read the replacement history and its explicit uncertified contact figures against the preserved package replay. The byte-identical GLB establishes frozen construction preservation only; earlier numeric contacts, alternate assemblies and whole-PR review are not recertified here.
 * @evidence {@link portraitReview} Retains the construction review carrier for this assembled face; its written observations do not accept the likeness.
