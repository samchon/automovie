/**
 * Replace an entire connected region with a source patch and a shared annulus.
 * Both loops follow the winding of the faces they enclose. Their XY projection
 * must define a simple outer ring with the source strictly inside. The engine
 * triangulates that annular region while retaining its exact input coordinates.
 * Those 2D identities address the original 3D vertices, so no depth is flattened
 * and no independent overlay or second normal field is introduced.
 *
 * The source provider runs at fit time and must be deterministic. Its returned
 * mesh is copied before attachment. The caller owns provenance, common-frame
 * placement and a suitable nested boundary arrangement. Connectivity admission
 * does not certify a smooth outer join or absence of geometric intersections;
 * those require actual geometry measurement and rendered inspection.
 * Optional attachment first places the host boundary on the complete source
 * surface along the view ray. Its constraints use the existing host skin blend;
 * omission leaves the original host controls unchanged. After refinement and
 * anatomical layers, a bounded fairing solve joins the final neighbouring
 * surfaces with fixed shared boundaries. The donor core and host are fixed;
 * position mode moves annulus-interior vertices along the recorded view ray.
 * Tangent mode keeps a positive XY chart, matches its first row to neighbouring
 * planes, then adapts the complete source height surface by bounded displacement.
 *
 * preserveSource reserves the coarse host region instead of inserting the
 * sampled source into Loop subdivision. Its actual refined boundary is recovered
 * after host layers, then the source is installed unchanged. Interior edge and
 * face splits add movable join samples; source and host boundaries stay shared.
 * Omission retains the control-cage path and its existing subdivision behavior.
