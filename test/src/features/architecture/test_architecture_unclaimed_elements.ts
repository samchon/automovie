/**
 * Only a hierarchy root no space claims is left over for the index to name.
 *
 * Leaving an element unassigned is correct rather than careless: an exterior
 * wall, a foundation, and a structural frame belong to no room. Measured on the
 * scaffold's own `ExampleBuilding`, 9 of its 30 elements are claimed by no
 * space, and all nine are envelope or vertical-transport machinery — four
 * curtain panels, a facade ladder, a lift car, a car shell, a counterweight and
 * its block — while every floor slab, partition, door and leaf is claimed. So
 * the space tree indexes a building rather than covering it.
 *
 * What covers it is the element hierarchy, which the record says is total:
 * every element descends from exactly one unit's roots. A child therefore
 * arrives among its parent's members and a claimed element among its space's,
 * which leaves exactly one population over — a root carrying no space of its
 * own. Taking the compiled scene's drawn set as the notion of reach instead
 * named seven of `ExampleBuilding`'s envelope pieces as roots although the unit
 * root above them is claimed by a space, so the listing said they hang from
 * nothing while the record said otherwise.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A unit root no space claims is named, because nothing else lists it.
 * 2. A unit root a space claims is not named: that space lists it.
 * 3. An element with a parent is never named, whether or not a space claims it
 *    and whether or not the builder drew its parent, because its parent lists
 *    it.
 * 4. The fixture carrying all three is a legal building, so the rule is read
 *    off a record the engine accepts rather than off an invented one.
