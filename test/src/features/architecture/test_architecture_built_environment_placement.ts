/**
 * Building placement review reuses authored geometry and compact population
 * bounds instead of asking a reviewer to infer support from rendered pixels.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. An environment-owned element and a compact three-member population return
 *    hand-derived world boxes and preserve their different measurement bases.
 * 2. A missing element and a transform-only group remain unresolved, while an
 *    element citing a runtime model reference resolves to the one world origin
 *    the record does state and labels that box `element-origin-point`.
 * 3. Bearing against an element and an authored surface classifies exact
 *    contact, positive gap, penetration, no planar support, and the exact
 *    tolerance boundary; omitted tolerance takes the deterministic default.
 * 4. A declared chandelier suspension is legitimate only when both its body
 *    and named ceiling resolve; every subject/support unresolved combination
 *    reports the exact missing side and retains the basis of the side it knows.
 * 5. Negative and non-finite tolerances are refused rather than silently
 *    changing the meaning of contact.
 * 6. Named-neighbour bounds distinguish positive-volume overlap, exact face
 *    contact, separation, conservative population involvement, and unresolved
 *    operands without expanding population members.
 * 7. An extent-free body is never silently confused with a measured one: it
 *    bears from its origin and clears its neighbour, and both answers carry the
 *    basis that says no volume was measured.
