/**
 * `resolveShotLighting` is the applier that makes a shot's light-time axis real
 * (#1348): the consumer that turns "the candle is 1.4 candela until 1.6s and
 * 0.04 after" from a committed statement into a number at any frame.
 *
 * Expected values here come from the glTF sampler contract and hand arithmetic,
 * not from what the pass emits. STEP holds `v_k` for `t_k <= t < t_{k+1}`, so
 * the value at the cue instant is the value AFTER the cue, and LINEAR at the
 * midpoint of a segment is the mean of its endpoints.
 *
 * The pass exists because the axis without an applier is #1339's false green
 * and an applier that skips part of its input is #1349, so every refusal here
 * is loud: a track this pass cannot honor throws rather than resolving to
 * something plausible.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. S-03 realized. The blowout clip evaluates to 1.4 at `t = 0` (the lower
 *    boundary), 1.4 at the key `t = 1.55`, 1.4 at frame 38 of 72 (`38/24`),
 *    0.04 exactly AT the cue `t = 1.6`, 0.04 at frame 39 (`39/24`), and 0.04 at
 *    `t = duration` (the upper boundary). The one-keyframe hold the guide tells
 *    an author to write on the FOLLOWING beat (lighting does not inherit across
 *    a cut the way placement does) reads the same value at every instant.
 * 2. The negative twin the mission requires: a light no clip addresses comes back
 *    by IDENTITY, and so does every light when the shot carries no clips at
 *    all. A film that never changes its light gets the lights it staged,
 *    unchanged.
 * 3. Every property in the table applies, on a light kind that carries it: a
 *    linear colour ramp read at its exact midpoint (`(1,0.8,0.5)` → `(0,0,0)`
 *    at `t = 1` of `[0, 2]` is `(0.5, 0.4, 0.25)`), a point light's `range`,
 *    and a spot's `coneAngle`. An animated colour drops the staged `hex` label,
 *    which describes a value the light no longer holds. Every KIND also
 *    rebuilds with exactly the parameters its discriminator carries: a dimmed
 *    directional has no falloff to keep, and a dimmed spot keeps the range and
 *    cone it was staged with rather than losing them to the write.
 * 4. Two tracks on ONE light both land (intensity and range together), so the pass
 *    accumulates per light rather than letting the last track win.
 * 5. Four loud refusals, one per way an artifact can address something the pass
 *    cannot write: a node channel, a pointer that is not a light pointer, a
 *    light the scene does not stage, and `range` on a directional light (a kind
 *    that carries no falloff). Each throws instead of skipping.
