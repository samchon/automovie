/**
 * The convergence proof of #594 S3: a real performed film shot plays back
 * IDENTICALLY through the general Clip path. The duel fixture runs the actual
 * pipeline (forge → stage → perform), each actor's compiled humanoid motion is
 * baked through `motionToClip` with its placement prefix, the tracks merge into
 * ONE clip over the ONE `sceneToNodes` graph, and at every bake-clock time each
 * actor's every bone world from `resolveFrame` equals the specialized path:
 * `placement ∘ resolvePose(sampleMotion(motion, t))`. The engine's execution
 * representation converges on Clip while `IAutoMovieMotion` stays the authoring
 * surface.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. The merge precondition: every compiled motion fits the shot and at least one
 *    spans it exactly: a shorter actor's tracks end early and HOLD, the same
 *    clamp-hold boundary rule `sampleMotion` applies, so the merged clip is
 *    well-formed (track times ≤ clip duration).
 * 2. For every bake time and both actors, every bone's world position and rotation
 *    agree between the specialized and general paths (1e-6), including the hold
 *    window where the shorter actor has ended (the hold semantics agree across
 *    both pipelines).
 * 3. The negative twin: reading knightA's bones through knightB's prefix does NOT
 *    match: the per-placement prefixes really keep the two actors' subtrees
 *    distinct (the knights stand 0.7 m apart, facing opposite ways).
