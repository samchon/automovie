 * `maskMotionToRegion` strips `expression` from every region except `face`

 * through on ANY region's clip, so a host synthesizer authoring a grimace on a
 * fullBody stagger overlapped an emote UNGATED: layering resolves expressions
 * last-envelope-wins and one silently ate the other, defeating the
 * fullBody↔face exemption's disjointness claim. Now only the face region's
 * owner speaks for the face, by construction.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A single non-face region (`upperBody`) clip carrying an expression compiles
 *    with every keyframe's expression stripped.
 * 2. Negative twin: the same clip on the `face` region keeps its expression at
 *    every keyframe.
 * 3. Layered disjointness: a fullBody clip authoring "angry" beside a face clip
 *    authoring "happy": the composite carries only the face region's "happy";
 *    the fullBody grimace never surfaces.
