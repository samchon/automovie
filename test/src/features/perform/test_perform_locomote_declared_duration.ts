/**
 * An explicit `duration` on a `locomote` is the action's span, not advice.
 *
 * The engine sized every walk from distance and the actor's speed and discarded
 * the number the author wrote: a walk declared 7.5 s compiled to 3.0 s with no
 * violation, no warning, and nothing in the guide corpus saying it would
 * (#1366). That is the substitute-in-silence shape #1349 refused for channels,
 * moved from content to timing, and `duration` is the one declared quantity
 * `performShot` already treats as authoritative everywhere else: its `spanOf`
 * gates action overlap and covers blocking anchors with exactly this number, so
 * the compiled clip and the gates were reading two different timelines.
 *
 * The geometry is countable by hand: a 1 s gait cycle at 1 m/s covers one metre
 * per stride, and the destination is three metres straight ahead, so the
 * engine's own sizing is three whole cycles and 3.0 s. Every expectation below
 * is that arithmetic, never a value read back from the synthesiser.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. The reproduction: `start: 2.5`, `duration: 7.5`, a target 3.0 s away at the
 *    gait's speed. The clip spans 7.5 s and the compiled performance ends at
 *    10.0 s, where it used to end at 5.5 s (2.5 + the substituted 3.0).
 * 2. The fit changes the cadence, NOT the path: the declared walk arrives at the
 *    same three metres the auto walk arrives at, and its `gaitCycle.period`
 *    scales with the clip (1 s → 2.5 s) so the recorded stride phase a later
 *    beat resumes from stays honest.
 * 3. `"auto"` keeps its meaning exactly: the same action sized by the engine still
 *    compiles the natural 3.0 s of three whole cycles.
 * 4. A quicker span works the same way in the other direction (1.5 s, half the
 *    natural), so the fit is not a one-sided "extend".
 * 5. The boundary: a declared duration equal to the natural one is a no-op, which
 *    is what makes the fit a scale rather than a rewrite.
 * 6. The step-in-place arms take the span too: a relative target (no resolvable
 *    point) and a destination the actor already stands on both honour an
 *    explicit duration, and both keep the single natural cycle under `"auto"`.
