/**
 * `bodyRegionBones`: the disjoint-and-complete partition of the humanoid
 * skeleton into body regions, the basis for layering clips on non-overlapping
 * regions.
 *
 * Completeness is not asserted here, and the count below is documentation
 * rather than proof. This scenario used to claim the three regions "cover the
 * full 55-bone VRM rig exactly" while comparing them only with each other, so a
 * bone added to the union and to no region kept every assertion green while
 * every mask stripped it (#1400). The claim now belongs to the builder:
 * `AUTOMOVIE_RIG_IS_PARTITIONED` types as `true` only while the partition
 * covers `AutoMovieHumanoidBone`, and an escaped bone fails the build by name.
 * What is left for run time is what a type cannot see: disjointness, the empty
 * face region, and `fullBody` really being the three concatenated.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Each region owns the expected bones (lower = hips+legs, upper = torso+arms+
 *    fingers, head = neck/head/eyes/jaw, face = none).
 * 2. The three bony regions are pairwise disjoint.
 * 3. `fullBody` is exactly their concatenation, element for element. Nothing here
 *    asserts completeness: an assertion that cannot fail is not a guard, and
 *    `AUTOMOVIE_RIG_IS_PARTITIONED` is a type, checked when the engine builds.
