/**
 * A `lookAt` meets its subject's **eyes**, not the ground its feet stand on.
 *
 * A scene node's `transform.translation` is a placement, and staging writes an
 * actor's position straight into it, so a humanoid's node origin sits between
 * its feet. Resolving a `lookAt` there aimed the head at the floor: from 1.6 m
 * of eye height at 0.7 m of separation the aim needs 66.37 degrees of flexion
 * against the 45 degree head limit, so two actors at conversational range could
 * not regard each other at all, and the agent saw only an opaque `rom`
 * violation on the compiled clip. The camera solve had already answered the
 * same problem with a measured aim fraction of the subject's height; this is
 * the aim verb's half of that answer, using `eyeHeight`, the one datum the
 * context defines for exactly this purpose.
 *
 * Every expected angle below is computed from `atan2` on the stated geometry,
 * never read back from the synthesizer.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Two 1.6 m-eyed actors 0.7 m apart: the aim is level and dead ahead (`flexion`
 *    and `twist` both 0), and the SAME target written as an explicit point at
 *    the subject's placement still demands `atan2(1.6, 0.7) = 66.37` degrees,
 *    which is the difference the lift makes, stated as a pair.
 * 2. Unequal eye heights (1.6 looking at 1.2 from 2 m) tilt down by `atan2(0.4,
 *    2)`, so the lift is each subject's own datum, not a constant.
 * 3. A `group` target averages the members' EYE points: the centroid of `(0, 1.6,
 *    0.7)` and `(0, 1.2, 2)` is `(0, 1.4, 1.35)`, so the aim is `atan2(0.2,
 *    1.35)` downward. Group support falls out of the table rather than a second
 *    code path, and this is what proves it.
 * 4. Negative twins, the ids with no actor context: a set piece and a camera each
 *    compile byte-identically to an explicit `point` at their placement, so the
 *    lift applies to actors only.
 * 5. Boundary: an actor whose `eyeHeight` is 0 compiles byte-identically to a
 *    point at its placement, the zero-lift case that proves the lift is the
 *    only thing that changed.
 * 6. Regression: a relative target still synthesises nothing, and an unplaced id
 *    still synthesises nothing, so the aim table did not widen what resolves.
