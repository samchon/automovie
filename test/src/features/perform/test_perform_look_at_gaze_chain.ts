/**
 * `lookAt` aims with the whole **gaze chain**, so a steep look compiles inside
 * the ROM the rig declares instead of piling the entire angle on one bone.
 *
 * The solver used to write the solved aim onto `head` alone, so two actors
 * looking down at a document emitted `head` flexion 47.726…° against a declared
 * `[-30, 30]`, while the `neck` the same `head` region owns sat at zero with
 * `[-50, 60]` to spare (#1360). The author cannot correct that by authoring
 * differently: the gaze angle is engine-solved from the target and the rig, so
 * the only recovery left was widening the head bone until one joint carried the
 * whole cervical range, which makes the rig lie about the body. This is #1345's
 * ROM-aware arm chain, one joint up.
 *
 * Every expected angle is computed from `atan2` on the stated geometry and
 * every split from the declared ranges; nothing is read back from the
 * synthesiser. `validatePoseResult` is the ROM oracle, the same gate
 * `performShot` runs the compiled clip through.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. The reproduction: `atan2(1.1, 1) = 47.726…°` of downward aim on the S-06
 *    chain compiles with ZERO violations, `head` at its declared 30° maximum
 *    and `neck` carrying the remaining 17.726…°, and the two sum to exactly the
 *    angle the single-bone solve demanded, so the aim itself is unchanged.
 * 2. The negative twin: an aim the head holds on its own (16.699°) emits the
 *    single `head` joint it always did, with no `neck` in the pose at all, so
 *    the distribution is a strict extension rather than a new pose shape.
 * 3. The opposite hemisphere: an upward aim (−54.462°) splits by the same rule
 *    through the `min` side of both ranges, which a `Math.min`-only split would
 *    get backwards.
 * 4. The other axis: a 90° turn to the actor's left splits `twist` 30 + 60 while
 *    `flexion` stays 0 on the head and absent from the neck, so an axis that
 *    needs no help contributes no rotation.
 * 5. An IMMOBILE head twist (`null`, which `validateJointRom` reads as "must be
 *    null or 0") sends the whole 60° turn to the neck and leaves the head at
 *    exactly 0, which stays legal.
 * 6. A chain that genuinely cannot span the aim keeps failing UNCLAMPED, like a
 *    reach: with the neck narrowed to `[-10, 10]` the residual rides the head,
 *    so the gate reports one violation whose overshoot is exactly how far the
 *    whole declared chain falls short (47.726 − 40).
 * 7. A rig-less actor context keeps the single-bone aim byte for byte: there is no
 *    declared ROM to distribute against, and `performShot` runs no ROM gate on
 *    such an actor either.
 * 8. A rig that declares no `neck` bone also keeps the single-bone aim: naming a
 *    bone the skeleton does not carry would trade one violation for another.
