 * A named performer and a crowd member stand on one ground.

 * They used to stand on two. The world's terrain could state sampled relief and

 * and foot-plants on could only be a level or a single plane, so the same rise
 * moved the crowd and left the figure beside it flat. Two records answered "how
 * high is the ground here" and one of them could not say.
 *
 * The scene surface now carries the same `IAutoMovieHeightRule` the world
 * surface carries, and `surfaceHeightAt` is the one function that reads it, for
 * both records and every consumer downstream of them.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Both records answer the same number, bit for bit, at lattice points, inside
 *    cells, and off the lattice edge: not close, identical, because one
 *    function answers.
 * 2. A crowd member placed on the terrain and a performer standing at that
 *    member's exact point read one height. Five members abreast across the
 *    slope, each compared with the ground query the foot planter uses.
 * 3. A foot plant on relieved ground lands on it: the raw path bake skates,
 *    `plantStanceFeet` against the staged relief corrects it, and the corrected
 *    clip passes `validateGroundContact` judged against that same relief.
 * 4. A staged space that declares no relief is unchanged: the two-anchor spelling
 *    answers exactly the heights it always answered, an absent ramp anchor is
 *    the flat patch an explicit `null` is, a patch stating no ground at all
 *    reads the scalar zero plane instead of throwing, and `stageScene` composes
 *    the space byte for byte with no field it did not carry before.
