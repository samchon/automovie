/**
 * Bounded segment witnesses describe the same separation used by scalar
 * distance checks. Facing endpoints and exact contact have independent
 * known witnesses, including zero distance where a normal needs a fallback.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Two colinear, separated segments: the closest pair is the facing endpoints
 *    and the distance is the gap.
 * 2. A segment endpoint lying on the other segment: the pair coincides and the
 *    distance is zero (the case a contact normal must fall back from).
