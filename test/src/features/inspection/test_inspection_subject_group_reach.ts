/**
 * A walk that knows no key reaches every element, and names none it cannot open.
 *
 * A transform-only group is an authored element with an identity, a kind, a
 * parent and a logical space, but the surface answered "does not exist" for it,
 * and that refusal did not stay inside the group. A space lists the elements it
 * claims, so a reviewer opening a room was handed ids that opened nothing: on
 * the scaffold's own `ExampleBuilding`, 6 of the 32 ids its spaces name refused,
 * both unit roots among them, and the elements underneath those roots appeared
 * at the top of the index as though they hung from nothing. Opening the group
 * closes both halves at once, and afterwards that building answers 30 of 30
 * elements from 2 index roots with no refusal.
 *
 * A group states its place the way the engine already states it, since
 * `builtEnvironmentPlacementBounds` answers `null` for a transform-only group
 * "because neither states a place a body occupies": no transform, no content
 * bounds, no materials, no prototype, and the structure a walk needs.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A group a space claims opens, and reports its kind, its owner, its space,
 *    and null for everything it does not stage.
 * 2. A group with no children reports an empty membership rather than refusing,
 *    and a root group reports no owner.
 * 3. Every id a space names opens, which is the defect stated from the side a
 *    reviewer meets it.
 * 4. A walk from the index reaches all seven elements, including the two the
 *    builder draws nothing for.
 * 5. The enumeration carries the groups too, so a flat survey is not smaller
 *    than the building.
