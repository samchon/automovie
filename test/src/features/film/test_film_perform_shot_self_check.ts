/**
 * The producer states the contract its output satisfies.
 *
 * The shot artifact's rules used to live only beside the commit gate, so
 * `performShot` could assemble a shot no consumer would accept and still report
 * success. The same failure recurred five times (#1224, #1308, #1314, #1316,
 * #1318), each closed by teaching the producer one more field, which is
 * whack-a-mole at the architecture layer. The rules now have one home, in the
 * engine, and `performShot` checks its own output against them before returning
 * (#1320).
 *
 * A failure is an ENGINE defect, not an authoring fault: every author-reachable
 * way to reach it is gated upstream and refused with a path the author can act
 * on. Reaching the self-check means a gate is missing, so it throws rather than
 * returning violations that would blame the wrong party (#1294's lesson), which
 * matches how the engine already reports precondition violations elsewhere
 * (`sampleClip`, `computeRestHeight`, `aimYawPitch` all throw).
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. An ordinary shot performs, so the self-check is silent on valid output. The
 *    whole rest of the film suite is this assertion repeated, since every
 *    `performShot` call now passes through the check.
 * 2. The net catches a gap no field gate covers. `staged.scene.id` is validated
 *    nowhere on this path: `stageScene` would refuse an empty one, but an
 *    EXPLICIT staged set never passes through staging, and the shape gate
 *    only requires a string. So an empty scene id reaches `shot.scene`, which
 *    the artifact contract refuses. Before the self-check this returned
 *    `success: true` with an uncommittable shot, exactly like the five fixed
 *    cases; now it throws, naming the field and saying whose defect it is.
 * 3. The throw is diagnosable: it carries the violating path and says the fault is
 *    the engine's, not the author's, so the message cannot be mistaken for a
 *    correction the author should make.
