/**
 * Staging may author the scene's `space` (#1173): the ground's MEANING beside
 * the `set`'s geometry. `stageScene` gates it with the shared `validateSpace`
 * (re-rooted under `$input.space`, so one surface rule can never mean two
 * things) and copies it onto the composed scene, which is what finally lets the
 * pairing `IAutoMovieSurface` documents be authored end to end: before this the
 * space type existed and nothing ever emitted one.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A floor + ramp space stages onto the scene verbatim (ids, kinds, anchors, and
 *    walkability), and the composed scene feeds `spaceGround` directly: 0 m
 *    over the floor, 0.5 m at the ramp's midpoint (half of the 1 m climb), and
 *    the 0 m fallback off every footprint.
 * 2. Omitting `space` composes `space: null`, the scalar ground plane the engine
 *    assumed before spaces existed: an absent ground is stated, not implied.
 * 3. The gates fire at the submitted field: a self-crossing footprint, a
 *    degenerate ramp axis, and a walkable id resolving to no surface are each
 *    refused under `$input.space.*` in one round. The footprint witness used to
 *    be a concave one, which #1868 made legal — `surfaceContains` classifies
 *    against the authored ring now, so a notch is a shape rather than something
 *    the validator has to forbid on the query's behalf. A ring that crosses
 *    itself is what the footprint gate still refuses, because two lobes meeting
 *    at a crossing leave no inside for a foot to be on.
 * 4. The negative twin, and it is the exact inverse of what this case pinned
 *    before: the concave quadrilateral one property away from that bowtie —
 *    same four corners, one of them pulled inside instead of across — stages
 *    clean. So the footprint gate refuses a ring with no inside rather than
 *    every four-point polygon that is not convex.
