/**
 * The production bridge of #1187's multi-camera half: `performShot` compiles
 * the blocking's `coverage` intents into alternate takes on `shot.coverage`
 * while the hero take keeps its singular `camera`/`cameraMotion` and its one
 * live `frame` election. A coverage camera never enters the election; it plays
 * its own intent across the whole beat from its own staged bearing, so a render
 * host can cut to the angle at any instant.
 *
 * The staged cameras sit at the aim height with `fovY = 90°`, so every expected
 * key is hand arithmetic: subject height 1.2 m (the fixture rig's measured rest
 * height), `medium` aim 0.72 × 1.2 = 0.864 m, framed distance (0.62 × 1.2) / 2
 * / tan(45°) = 0.372 m along the bearing from the aim point to the staged
 * camera.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. One coverage intent (cam-alt, medium static on knightA) → one take naming
 *    cam-alt, its clip id `cam:beat-1:cam-alt`, both tracks on cam-alt, a
 *    single key at (0, 0.864, −0.372) rotated 180° about +Y (looking back down
 *    +Z), and one intent record `{ start: 0, medium, static, focus null, lens
 *    null }`. The hero take is untouched: camera `cam-main`, keyed at (0.372,
 *    0.864, 0).
 * 2. Two coverage intents on distinct cameras compile two takes in blocking order,
 *    and a `push-in` alternate dollies 1.25× → 0.8× of the framed distance
 *    (first key x = −0.465, last key x = −0.2976): the alternate rides the same
 *    move grammar, not a static-only shortcut.
 * 3. Boundaries: an omitted `coverage`, an explicit `[]`, and an omitted
 *    `blocking` all assemble the shot with `coverage: []` (one camera), and the
 *    hero clip stays byte-identical to the covered run (coverage never
 *    re-enters the hero solve).
 * 4. Gates at `$blocking.coverage[i]`: an unstaged camera, an empty camera id, the
 *    elected live camera itself, and a repeat all violate `.camera`; a forged
 *    framing/move violates `.framing`/`.move`; an unstaged node subject
 *    violates `.on`.
 * 5. Negative twins: two distinct staged cameras and a point-target coverage each
 *    fire nothing, so no gate over-matches a legitimate angle.
