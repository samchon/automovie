/**
 * Pins the happy path of the FORGE consumer and its join with staging: the one
 * cast member without a `modelRef` gets exactly one validated stand-in, keyed
 * by its node, and the staged scene's `modelRef ?? node` fallback resolves to
 * that forged model's id.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. The duel cast (knightA imports "stickman", knightB has no modelRef) with one
 *    forge entry for knightB → success; `models` holds exactly knightB's rig
 *    with a skeleton.
 * 2. Chained into `stageScene`, knightB's scene node carries model "knightB": the
 *    exact key `forgeCast` validated, closing the loop from forge to stage.
