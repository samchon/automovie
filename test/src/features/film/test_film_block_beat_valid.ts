/**
 * Pins the happy path of the BLOCKING consumer: a plan whose beat the script
 * planned, whose intents belong to placed actors, whose anchors sit on the
 * beat's timeline in causal order, and whose camera favours a staged actor
 * passes through verbatim.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. The duel blocking (strike anchored at t = 1 inside a 2-second beat, medium
 *    static camera on knightA) → success carrying the plan unchanged.
 * 2. Multiple anchors in ascending order (0.5 then 1.5) → still coherent.
