 * reachable, and pin that a production saying nothing about light is
 * untouched.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. One production source lights two shots differently, because each shot reads
 *    it at the story moment its own pin fixes: the source ramps from 3 to 1
 *    across the span, so a shot pinned at its opening reads 3 and one pinned
 *    halfway reads 2.
 * 2. A production stating no lighting leaves the shot's staged lights exactly as
 *    staged, element for element.
 * 3. A shot program's own `lightMotions` reach the compiled shot, and a program
 *    stating none compiles a shot carrying no such field at all.
