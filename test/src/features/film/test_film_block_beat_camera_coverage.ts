/**
 * The multi-camera half of #1187 at the BLOCKING consumer: a beat may plan
 * additional staged cameras as `coverage` intents beside the singular hero
 * `camera`. Each coverage camera must exist in the staging exactly once, favour
 * something placed, and state a real framing/move: unlike the hero intent,
 * coverage has no downstream coherence gate to catch a garbage value, so the
 * closed unions are gated here.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. One coverage entry (cam-alt, medium static on knightB) → success, the plan
 *    carried verbatim, coverage included.
 * 2. Two coverage entries on distinct cameras (cam-alt + cam-wide) → success, the
 *    multi-camera case; the empty list `coverage: []` → success too, the
 *    omitted-equivalent boundary.
 * 3. An unstaged coverage camera and an empty camera id → `type` at
 *    `$input.coverage[0].camera`; a repeated coverage camera → `type` at
 *    `$input.coverage[1].camera` naming the first declaration.
 * 4. A coverage favouring the unstaged `ghost` → `type` at `.on.node`; a forged
 *    framing or move name → `type` at `.framing` / `.move`.
 * 5. Negative twins: a point-target coverage fires no `.on.node` violation (a
 *    point needs no placement), and two DISTINCT cameras fire no duplicate
 *    violation (the over-match counter-example for scenario 3).
