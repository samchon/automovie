/**
 * A prop drawing a registered external appearance is judged by every placement
 * rule a generated one is, as the subject of a claim and as the host of one.
 *
 * The whole point of admitting the reference is that nothing the prop means
 * travels out with the pixels, so this pins the measurable half of that claim:
 * the chair is contained, borne, cleared, and held out of passages through its
 * deterministic proxy, and other props rest on the seat face its own spec
 * declares.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. The imported chair, the lamp standing on its seat, and the stool beside them
 *    resolve: an external appearance forges and stages like any other prop.
 * 2. As a subject it is refused where a generated prop would be: floating off the
 *    floor it names, leaving the logical space it occupies, and standing in the
 *    doorway.
 * 3. Its keep-out volume is its own: the stool pushed into the chair's pull-out
 *    clearance is refused, and the stool pushed into the chair itself is
 *    refused as occupancy with no declared contact.
 * 4. As a host it bears: the lamp floats above and sinks into the seat face the
 *    imported chair declares, and stands off it when moved away.
 * 5. A chair whose sealed closure is broken does not forge, and is therefore not
 *    also measured: the forge violation is reported at the prop's own path and
 *    the geometric refusal it would otherwise have earned is not.
