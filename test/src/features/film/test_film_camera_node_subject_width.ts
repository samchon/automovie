/**
 * A required node subject is framed and graded on the width its geometry
 * actually fills, at the place that geometry actually stands.
 *
 * A node subject used to carry a height and nothing else. `performShot` framed
 * it from that height and stated no `radius`, and `realizeShotContract` boxed it
 * with `pointSubjectBox`, so a 60 m facade authored outward from its element
 * origin was solved and checked as a pole: a graded box of `(0,0,0)…(0,24,0)`
 * against a drawn box of `x 0…60, y 0…24, z −1…1`, the pole standing 30.000 m
 * from the mass's own centre with 60 m of width and 2 m of depth dropped.
 *
 * Both sides now read one measured box, and they had to move together: widening
 * the grade alone would refuse shots no authored camera could satisfy, and
 * widening the solve alone would deliver a frame the check still graded against
 * a pole.
 *
 * The oracles are hand arithmetic rather than the engine's own output. The
 * drawn box is the slab's dimensions about its authored centre; `radius` is
 * half the horizontal diagonal, `hypot(60, 2) / 2 = 30.016662…`; a `full`
 * framing shows 1.15 subject extents, so the vertical fit stands at
 * `24 × 1.15 / 2 / tan(20°) = 37.915…` m and the horizontal fit at
 * `60.033… × 1.15 / 2 / (tan(20°) × 16/9) = 53.331…` m, and the solve takes the
 * further of the two.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. The fixture draws where it claims: the model's rest box runs
 *    `x 0…60, y 0…24, z −1…1`, so every number below is about a 60 m width and
 *    a 2 m depth measured off a 24 m height.
 * 2. Restated for the framing grammar, that box has its base at the middle of
 *    the mass and a radius of half its horizontal diagonal — not a base at the
 *    element origin and a radius of zero.
 * 3. A yawed element is boxed where it stands: a 90° set piece placed at
 *    `(100, 0, 5)` fills `x 99…101, z −55…5`, which a vertical segment at a
 *    point could not express at all.
 * 4. The width decides the distance exactly where it demands the further stand.
 *    The measured solve stands at the horizontal fit, 53.331 m, against the
 *    37.915 m the height alone asked for, and it aims at the middle of the mass
 *    rather than at its corner.
 * 5. The delivered frame is the difference: the measured camera holds both ends
 *    of the facade, and the height-only camera does not hold the far one.
 * 6. Solve and grade agree. The facade reads at every contract sample under the
 *    camera the measured subject produced.
 * 7. The grade moved to where the geometry is rather than merely growing around
 *    the origin: a facade authored entirely away from its element origin is
 *    refused under the camera the height-only solve produced — that camera
 *    delivers a frame with none of the subject in it — and reads under the
 *    measured one.
 * 8. A wall delivered as an ingested mesh rather than as a generated primitive
 *    draws the same box, because the measurement reads vertices either way.
 * 9. `performShot` itself resolves the subject on those terms, so what is
 *    pinned is the builder's own reading rather than one rebuilt beside it.
 * 10. Boundaries. A node with nothing to measure keeps the horizontally
 *    degenerate stand-in segment it always had, and a slab too thin to measure
 *    vertically keeps its real width while taking the stand-in height.
