/**
 * What a shot may NOT turn, and why each refusal is a defect caught rather than
 * a preference enforced.
 *
 * The channel exists so a door can swing. Every one of these would produce a
 * compiled shot that reads as if something moves and either moves nothing,
 * moves two things against each other, or moves one thing past a limit its own
 * record declares — the class of false green this pipeline refuses everywhere
 * else.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A node no shot staged, and a joint no staged prop declares, are both refused:
 *    a clip addressing nothing renders as silence.
 * 2. A node this shot's performance drives is refused; a performer moves off its
 *    rig, and a transform clip over it would fight the pose every frame.
 * 3. A swing past the travel the prop's own profile declares is refused, naming
 *    the profile and the channel rather than an anonymous bound; the adjacent
 *    swing one degree inside the same bound compiles.
 * 4. A key outside the shot's own clock is refused: a turn no frame reads.
 * 5. `cubicspline` is refused, because a spline's tangents can leave a declared
 *    travel between two keys the gate proved, and nothing clamps an object clip
 *    downstream.
 * 6. Two authored clips sharing one id are refused; `validateUniqueIds` would
 *    otherwise refuse the whole shot artifact with no authoring path to name.
 * 7. A pointer track is still refused on this field, because the transform-clip
 *    rule stands under the narrower one this field adds.
 * 8. A channel a baked clip already drives is refused, and it is refused per
 *    CHANNEL: the torch's baked follow owns its rotation, so a second rotation
 *    is two authorities the sampler would resolve by producer order.
 * 9. An id a baked clip already carries is refused here, where an authoring path
 *    can be named, rather than by the artifact gate that would throw.
 * 10. A prop joint whose lowered id collides with a staged scene node is named as
 *     the collision it is; composing that graph throws instead of reporting, so
 *     a shot carrying one may not be resolved at all.
 * 11. A shot that registers no prop still drives its staged set pieces, and a joint
 *     of the prop it no longer carries is refused: the registry is what lowers
 *     a joint, so dropping it drops the address.
 * 12. A prop the forge refuses lowers no joint either, and a node id declared twice
 *     keeps the first registration; both are the placement gate's faults to
 *     report, not this one's to report twice.
 * 13. A node path the pipeline never writes is refused by the transform-clip rule
 *     and compared against nothing, since an address with no canonical key
 *     cannot collide with one.
