/**
 * A camera frames a formation named as a group subject, at the extent that
 * formation really occupies.
 *
 * A mass is stored as one compact record and never as thousands of scene nodes,
 * so a group naming its members by id cannot name it at all: the ids do not
 * exist until a slot is materialized. Naming the unit is what makes it
 * addressable, and everything downstream of that name has to be the unit's own
 * geometry — the box its slots occupy, padded by a member's radius, raised by a
 * member's own drawn height, and moved by whatever cue is playing at the framed
 * instant.
 *
 * The oracle is the arithmetic. The wide unit is one rank of five at two-metre
 * intervals, so its slots span `[-4, 4]`; the compiled member radius no recipe
 * here overrides is 0.5, so its footprint is `[-4.5, 4.5] x [-0.5, 0.5]`; and
 * the member's own box stands two metres tall, so the whole of it is `[-4.5,
 * 4.5] x [0, 2] x [-0.5, 0.5]`. With `tan(fovY / 2) = 1` the framed distance is
 * half the visible span and `wide` shows four times the subject, so a two-metre
 * figure sits at 4 m and a mass at twice its own half-diagonal times four,
 * whichever of the two stands further back.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A group naming only the unit frames the unit: the compiled bounds and member
 *    radius are the ones the layout states, the standoff is the width that
 *    footprint demands, and the solved key is that far back along the staged
 *    bearing from the box's own bottom centre.
 * 2. A group naming only a staged node frames a body, an order of magnitude
 *    closer, so the distance above is the mass and not the framing grammar.
 * 3. A group naming both is framed at the union of both, which reaches from the
 *    node to the far flank of the unit and pulls the camera back past either
 *    answer alone.
 * 4. A unit of one member is narrow enough that the vertical fit decides, and the
 *    height that decides it is the member model's own two metres; supply no
 *    model for it and the documented stand-in decides instead. That pair is the
 *    whole of what reading the member's geometry buys.
 * 5. A cue is the only thing that moves a mass, so a unit carrying one is
 *    followed: the keys begin over the unit at rest and end over where the cue
 *    put it, which is the re-frame a marching mass needs. Without a cue the
 *    same group holds still and keys once, the documented degenerate follow.
