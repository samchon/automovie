/**
 * The perform gate must refuse an arm verb asked of a rig whose elbow cannot

 * would otherwise have made the failure QUIETER.
 *
 * Before, such a rig got a pose that loaded the bend onto abduction and twist,
 * so the shot failed loudly with ROM errors on axes the rig declared immobile.
 * Now `reachPose` refuses the rig outright, and a `null` synthesis is SKIPPED
 * by `compilePerformance` ("no motion for this actor, skip"), so without a gate
 * the shot would come back successful having performed nothing at all. That is
 * #1349's failure shape one verb lower, and trading a loud wrong answer for a
 * silent one is not a fix.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A `reach` on an arms-down rig is a `type` violation at the action's own
 *    `hand` field, carrying the rig's geometry rather than a missing clip.
 * 2. NEGATIVE TWIN: the identical shot on the T-pose rig passes. Only the rest
 *    direction changed, so only the rest direction can have caused the
 *    refusal.
 * 3. The arm GESTURES are gated on the same fact: `point` and `strike` always
 *    solve the right arm, so they are refused at their `kind` field on the same
 *    rig, and pass on the twin.
 * 4. Boundary: a shot with no arm verb at all is untouched on either rig, so the
 *    gate is scoped to the verbs that ask an arm-IK question and a quadruped
 *    that never reaches stays performable.
