/**
 * Pins the intent→realization gates that arm when a validated blocking rides
 * along with the performance: matching beat and duration, anchors covered by
 * their actor's actions, and the camera intent honoured by the lead frame.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. The duel blocking against the duel performance (strike anchor t = 1 inside
 *    the gesture's [1, 2] span; medium static frame) → success. An
 *    "auto"-duration action also covers a late anchor (knightB watched through
 *    the whole beat).
 * 2. Blocking for another beat → `type` on `$input.beat`.
 * 3. Blocking fixed at 3 s against a 2-second performance → `range` on
 *    `$input.duration`.
 * 4. An anchor at t = 0.2 for knightA: before any of knightA's actions (locomote
 *    starts at 0 but... it does cover 0.2; use knightB at t = 1.9 with no
 *    knightB action past the unison locomote's [0, 1] span) → `range` naming
 *    the dropped cue.
 * 5. Blocking asks close/push-in; the performance frames medium/static → `type` on
 *    the lead frame's `framing` and `move`.
 * 6. Blocking asks a follow camera; the performance authors no frame at all →
 *    `type` (a locked-off camera cannot follow).
