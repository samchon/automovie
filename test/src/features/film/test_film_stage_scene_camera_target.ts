/**
 * A camera may aim at any staged placement, another camera included.
 *
 * `performShot` resolves a positional target against every staged placement,
 * cameras among them (#1294), so a subject the performance stage happily frames
 * must not be refused one rung earlier. Staging built its own lookup from
 * actors and set pieces alone, which made "camera B opens on camera A" (a
 * making-of angle, a monitor, a mirror) impossible to stage while `perform`
 * accepted the same subject.
 *
 * Widening the table must not widen anything else: the two refusals staging
 * owns for a camera target, an id nothing placed and a camera aimed at its own
 * position, both still fire.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. `cam-b` aims at `cam-a` and composes the SAME rotation as an explicit `point`
 *    at `cam-a`'s position, which is what proves the id resolved to that
 *    camera's own placement rather than to some other one.
 * 2. That rotation aims the camera's local `-Z` (the glTF convention staging
 *    lowers every camera by) along `cam-a - cam-b`, normalised `(1, 0, 0)` for
 *    these two lenses: an independent geometric oracle, not a re-run of the
 *    engine's basis math.
 * 3. The counter-cases one property away still stage: an actor target and a set
 *    piece target compose as before.
 * 4. The negative twin: a camera aimed at an id nothing placed is still refused at
 *    `$input.cameras[0].lookAt.node`, and the message names all three placement
 *    flavours.
 * 5. The boundary the placement entry makes reachable: a camera aimed at ITSELF
 *    resolves to its own position, so the zero-length look vector is refused at
 *    `$input.cameras[0].lookAt` rather than composing a degenerate rotation.
