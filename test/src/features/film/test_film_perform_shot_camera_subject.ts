/**
 * A camera is a legal positional target (#1294), so a `frame` subject, a
 * `coverage` subject, and a `launch` aim may all name one. That widening put
 * camera ids into the placement table `resolveTargetPoint` reads, while the
 * staged-facing table stays nodes-only, so a camera subject has a base point
 * and no facing. Such a subject must hold still (`at: null`) rather than rotate
 * a root under an absent quaternion, and a `follow` on it degenerates to a
 * single key.
 *
 * A camera never reaches the compiled motion map: the input gate refuses a
 * camera as the actor of any verb but `frame`, and the one path that used to
 * slip past it, a `launch` carrying `onHit` at a camera injecting a `react`
 * that names the struck camera, is refused at the aim. So the fixture's loose
 * carries no `onHit`, and the shot's performances are asserted camera-free:
 * producing a shot whose performance node is not a scene node is exactly what
 * the artifact validator refuses at commit.
 *
 * The coverage half is reached the way a caller reaches it in production:
 * `perform` takes `blocking` as an ordinary argument, so a hand-written plan
 * arrives without passing through `block`. `blockBeat` now measures a coverage
 * subject against the same staged placements, cameras included, so the two
 * rungs agree; `test_film_block_beat_camera_target` pins that half.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A loose at `cam-main` plus a `follow` frame on `cam-main` assembles instead
 *    of throwing, and the follow degenerates to one key (the subject holds
 *    still), which is the documented `at: null` behaviour.
 * 2. No camera performs: `shot.performances` names only scene nodes, the invariant
 *    the artifact validator independently enforces.
 * 3. The same subject reached through the blocking's `coverage`: an alternate
 *    camera framing ANOTHER camera is legal, for the same reason the hero
 *    take's subject may be one, and its take degenerates identically.
 * 4. A `follow` plus focus on a moving target bone use the live resolver for both
 *    camera paths rather than freezing its rest point.
 * 5. Negative twin: a `follow` on `foe`, an actor that has both a staged facing
 *    and root travel, still tracks. Its keys move along the marched path, so
 *    the guard flattens only the facing-less case and no legitimate follow with
 *    it.
