/**
 * The continuity invariant behind "an hour of walking with no stutter at the
 * cuts": a beat-end state must let the next beat resume the gait exactly where
 * this beat left it. The carried gait phase re-samples to the very pose the
 * beat ended on, the folded transform is the exact world position to restage at
 * (with the pose root cleared so nothing double-applies), and the root velocity
 * matches the clip's true derivative, including at the loop seam, where a naive
 * finite difference across the wrap would report a teleport.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Mid-cycle end (2.25 s into a 1 s loop): gaitPhase = 0.25, world position
 *    folds to x = 0.5, and rootVelocity = the clip's constant 2 m/s.
 * 2. Resume equality: sampling the clip at the carried phase reproduces the end
 *    sample exactly (same joints, same root): the next beat's first frame IS
 *    this beat's last.
 * 3. Restage seam: the end pose's root is cleared, so an actor staged at the
 *    carried transform starts precisely at the end position, no double-apply.
 * 4. Exactly on the loop seam (2.0 s): phase wraps to 0 and velocity is measured
 *    on the cycle's closing stretch (clamped, not wrapped): still 2 m/s, not a
 *    backwards teleport.
 * 5. In the cycle's opening instants (phase < the finite-difference window) the
 *    window shrinks to [0, phase] and still reads 2 m/s.
