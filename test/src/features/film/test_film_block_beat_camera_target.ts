/**
 * What a blocking's camera intents may favour: any staged placement, an actor,
 * a set piece, or another camera.
 *
 * The performance stage resolves a positional target against every staged
 * placement, cameras among them (#1294), and never checks the blocking's `on`
 * against its own realization, so a plan naming a camera was refused at `block`
 * while the identical subject sailed through `perform`. That made "camera A
 * frames camera B" a beat that could be performed but never blocked. One rule,
 * one table, both rungs.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. The hero `camera.on` may name a staged camera; the counter-cases one property
 *    away, an actor and a set piece, still block.
 * 2. A `coverage` intent's `on` may name a staged camera too, the plural half of
 *    the same rule (#1187).
 * 3. The negative twins: an id nothing placed is still refused at
 *    `$input.camera.on.node` and at `$input.coverage[0].on.node`, and the
 *    message names every placement flavour rather than only "a placed actor".
 * 4. A coverage entry naming a camera that is not staged is still refused at
 *    `$input.coverage[0].camera`, so widening what a camera may FAVOUR did not
 *    widen which camera may COVER.
