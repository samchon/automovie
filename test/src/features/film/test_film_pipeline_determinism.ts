/**
 * Reproducibility is automovie's headline claim: the pipeline is deterministic
 * below the model. This runs the whole spine twice in ONE process and compares
 * the serialized artifacts byte-for-byte.
 *
 * What that gates and what it does NOT: two runs of a pure function are
 * byte-identical by construction, and Map/Set iteration order, `JSON.stringify`
 * key order, and float accumulation order are all per-process deterministic, so
 * this cannot fail on those ordering hazards; only an incidental IMPURITY
 * leaking between the two runs (a `Date.now()`/`Math.random()` reach, mutable
 * module state) makes them differ, and that is exactly what a same-process
 * double-run catches. The ordering hazards are covered where they can be: by
 * the oracle- derived per-value tests (which pin the numbers themselves) and,
 * for the cross-host ordering the determinism mandate is really about, by
 * `compareCodeUnits` replacing locale collation at every ordering site (#1225).
 * A committed golden digest would gate cross-process reproducibility too, but
 * it is a snapshot of the code's own output, the anti-oracle the coverage skill
 * warns against, so it is deliberately not used here.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Running the full stage -> perform -> cut spine twice from identical fixtures
 *    serializes byte-identically: no residual clock/RNG/global-state impurity.
 * 2. The serialized output actually carries the dense float artifact (the keyframe
 *    samples), so the check is a real signal, not a trivially-equal empty
 *    payload.
