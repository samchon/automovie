/**
 * The `locomote` gait gate. `gait` is a free string resolved by name against
 * the gaits the actor's context supplies; the reference synthesiser would
 * otherwise return no motion for an unknown one, silently freezing the actor.
 * With the `gaits` lookup wired, an unresolved gait is a `type` violation on
 * `$input.draft[i].gait`; without it the check is skipped (byte-identical to
 * before the gate existed).
 *
 * Cases: (a) a supplied gait passes; (b) an unsupplied gait is reported with
 * the actor's available names; (c) an actor with no gaits reads "none
 * supplied"; (d) omitting the lookup skips the gate entirely even for an
 * unknown gait.
