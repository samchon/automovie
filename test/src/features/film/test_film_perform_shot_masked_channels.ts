/**
 * `perform` must never drop authored content in silence (#1349). The
 * body-region mask is deliberate (disjoint regions are what let a walk and a
 * wave layer), but it used to discard whatever fell outside the action's region
 * and still return `success: true` with zero violations: a benchmark run
 * shipped a walking quadruped whose two front legs never moved, because a
 * retargeted quadruped's fore legs ride the humanoid ARM chains and an author
 * can explicitly narrow `locomote` to `lowerBody`. The builder holds both
 * facts at the moment it drops one, so it now states what it masked and the
 * shot gate refuses, pointing at the `region` field the author owns rather than
 * at the compiled clip they would have to diff.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Positive. A twelve-bone quadruped gait explicitly narrowed to `lowerBody`
 *    fails, with a `type` violation on `$input.draft[0].region` naming every
 *    one of the six masked fore-leg bones in code-unit order.
 * 2. Negative twin. The same gait with the default `fullBody` region performs, and
 *    all twelve authored bones reach the compiled clip.
 * 3. Boundary, the region's own bones. A gait confined to `hips` plus the hind
 *    chain (all inside `lowerBody`, `hips` being the member a leg chain sits
 *    next to) performs, and every one of those bones survives.
 * 4. The other two masked channels. A `head` action layered beside a `lowerBody`
 *    one loses its root, and any non-`face` clip loses its expression; both are
 *    named in one violation, while a clip losing only its expression names just
 *    that.
 * 5. One record per (action, actor): a unison action masked for two actors reports
 *    each separately, ordered by action index then actor id.
