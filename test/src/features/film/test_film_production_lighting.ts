/**
 * A production states ONE moving source and every shot inherits its state at
 * that shot's own story moment, instead of each shot restaging the light.
 *
 * The gap this closes is a scale gap. A shot's `lightMotions` runs on the
 * shot's clock, which is seconds long, so the longest statement a film could
 * make about its light was a few seconds long too. A production running a
 * stretch of story could not say the light crossed it, and every shot restaged
 * its own lighting with nothing at all relating the first shot's light to the
 * last's — consistency was whatever the author happened to retype.
 *
 * The clock is not invented here. `IAutoMovieShotStoryTime` — the pin a shot
 * already carries — is the affine map from shot-local seconds to story seconds,
 * so this pass is only ever "map the second, ask the one source". The edit is
 * not consulted at all: shots cut far apart may sit adjacent in the story, and
 * that is the fact a cut list cannot express and a pin can.
 *
 * Expected values are hand geometry and hand arithmetic. The source turns a
 * quarter turn about Y across the span, carrying its local −Z from `(0, 0, -1)`
 * to `(-1, 0, 0)`; the `quaternion` type makes that a SLERP, so the halfway
 * story moment is exactly 45° along. Intensity ramps linearly from 3 to 0.5, so
 * its halfway value is 1.75.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Two shots at different story times inherit DIFFERENT states from one source:
 *    shots pinned at the start, the middle and the end of the span read 0°/3,
 *    45°/1.75 and 90°/0.5. One declaration, three lightings, and nothing in any
 *    shot restating it.
 * 2. A shot's `rate` carries the same source at the shot's own pace: a two second
 *    shot pinned at 900 story seconds per shot second covers the whole span
 *    from within, so a film may run a long stretch of story inside a short take
 *    and the light crosses it correctly.
 * 3. The additivity promise, in both of its forms. A production that declares no
 *    lighting leaves the staged lights untouched, ELEMENT BY ELEMENT, and so
 *    does a shot carrying no story pin — an unpinned shot claims no story
 *    moment, so there is none at which to read a story-clock source, and
 *    assuming one would put every unpinned shot under the same light and call
 *    it a fact.
 * 4. The merge, by id and in a fixed order: a staged light the production names is
 *    replaced in place by the inherited state, a staged light it does not name
 *    comes back by identity, and a source the scene never staged is appended
 *    after them in declaration order.
