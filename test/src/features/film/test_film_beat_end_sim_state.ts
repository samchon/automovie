/**
 * The resumable-sim fields a beat-end state derives beyond the end pose:
 * one-shot clips have no cycle to resume, an ended clip holds still, held
 * actors carry nothing, and plant/mount data pass through with their carry
 * rules (latest plant per foot active at the end, rider-side mount binding).
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A non-looping clip mid-flight (0.5 s of 1 s): gaitPhase null (no cycle),
 *    rootVelocity = the clip's true 2 m/s.
 * 2. At the exact 1 s cut, the non-looping clip keeps its incoming 2 m/s left-hand
 *    velocity.
 * 3. The same clip past its end (2 s > 1 s) clamps and holds at zero velocity.
 * 4. A held actor: gaitPhase, rootVelocity, footPlants, and mount all null.
 * 5. Plants carry the latest active run per foot: a run beginning exactly at the
 *    cut supersedes an earlier overlapping run, a run ending exactly at the cut
 *    remains active, equal starts go to the later input, and past/future runs
 *    are filtered.
 * 6. No plant entry for a node, an empty entry, and an entry with only past/future
 *    runs all yield null.
 * 7. A staged mount is carried onto its rider; unmounted actors get null.
 * 8. Duplicated plant/mount node entries throw loudly.
 * 9. A degenerate zero-duration looping clip has no cycle to resume (null phase,
 *    zero velocity) instead of dividing by its empty period.
 * 10. A performance that starts exactly at shot end (local time 0) has an empty
 *     velocity window: zero, not NaN.
