/**
 * The whole stage ladder in one take. Every harness stage's payload flows
 * through its engine consumer with every gate passing: the script's stand-in is
 * forged, the world staged, the beat blocked, the performance realized against
 * that blocking, the shot reviewed and passed, the film cut, and the cut
 * resolved to render-ready frame samples. This is the pipeline the `agent`
 * package will drive with a real LLM; here the payloads are fixtures, which is
 * the point: everything below the model is deterministic.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Forge → stage: knightB's stand-in validates and its id is what the staged
 *    scene node carries.
 * 2. Block → perform: the duel blocking validates and the performance realizes it
 *    (anchor covered, camera intent honoured) into a shot with a compiled
 *    camera clip.
 * 3. Review: the shot passes with an empty backlog.
 * 4. Cut → playback: a 24 fps one-shot cut runs 2 s → exactly 48 frame samples,
 *    all on `shot:beat-1` starting at its first instant.
