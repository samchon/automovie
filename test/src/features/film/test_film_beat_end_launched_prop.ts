/**
 * A beat end reports a driven prop where the shot's own clips leave it.
 *
 * The end transform was resolved through an `attach:<node>` id prefix, so the
 * `trajectory:<node>` clip the SAME `perform` pass bakes for the same node was
 * invisible to it: a thrown stone's beat end read the attach clip that stops at
 * release and reported the stone still in the thrower's hand, contradicting the
 * committed shot it was resolved from (#1361). `commitBeatEnd` persists that,
 * so beat N+1 opens with the prop at its pre-throw position. Selection now
 * follows what a clip CARRIES and which one is in effect at the end instant,
 * not how its producer spelled the id.
 *
 * The geometry is the reproduction's: grab at 0, release at 2.2 from `(-0.71,
 * 1.35, 0)`, contact at 2.836250052458314 at `(0, 0, 5)`.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Past the landing, the beat end reports the stone where the flight left it,
 *    `(0, 0, 5)`, not the hand it was released from. The clip's last keyframe
 *    is the oracle, reached by clamping, exactly as the committed shot reads.
 * 2. Both directions of "in effect": BEFORE the release the same pair of clips
 *    resolves to the hand, so the flight does not win by merely existing.
 * 3. The flight alone (no attach bake, a prop thrown from rest) is honoured too,
 *    which is the case the id prefix could never reach.
 * 4. Selection is id-agnostic: a clip called `slide:stone`, matching neither
 *    convention, drives the end state because it drives the node.
 * 5. Negative twin: a shot carrying no clip for the node falls back to its staged
 *    placement, byte-identical to the pre-#674 path.
 * 6. A landed prop's end velocity is zero: the flight clip is clamped past
 *    contact, so nothing reports the stone as still travelling.
 * 7. Authority is per channel: a later translation-only clip supplies position
 *    while the earlier flight keeps supplying rotation.
 * 8. Array order decides nothing: the same two clips listed flight-first resolve
 *    to the flight, so it is the later START that wins, not the later entry.
 * 9. A transform authority that starts exactly at beat end has no preceding sample
 *    window, so its derived velocity is honestly zero.
