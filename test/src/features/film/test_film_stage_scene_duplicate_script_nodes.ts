 * Staging joins placed actors to the script cast by `node`, then chooses each
 * scene node's model with `modelRef ?? node`. Duplicate script cast nodes make
 * that model choice order-dependent.
 *
 * Scenario: `knightA` appears twice in the script cast with conflicting
 * `modelRef` values while both staged actors are otherwise valid; staging fails
 * at the duplicate script source path instead of silently using the later cast
 * member.
