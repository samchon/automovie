/**
 * A camera is a place to shoot at, never something that recoils.
 *
 * `launch`'s aim resolves against every staged placement, cameras included
 * (#1294), and that is right: a projectile thrown at the lens is ordinary film
 * grammar. But `onHit` schedules a RECOIL on the id it strikes, and the `react`
 * the engine injects is appended to the action list AFTER the input gate has
 * run, so it slipped past the very rule that refuses a camera as the actor of
 * any verb but `frame`. Left open, the shot compiles with a camera in
 * `shot.performances`, which the artifact validator then refuses at commit:
 * the engine declaring a shot successful that its own consumers cannot accept.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A launch at a staged camera with no `onHit` still performs, and no camera
 *    appears in `shot.performances`: aiming at the lens was never the problem.
 * 2. The same launch carrying `onHit` is refused at its own `.at` path, and the
 *    refusal names the camera rather than the target kind.
 * 3. The counter-case one property away: the same `onHit` aimed at a staged scene
 *    node performs, and the struck actor carries a performance, so the refusal
 *    is about the camera and not about `onHit`.
 * 4. `unbalance: true` is refused identically, before any `fall` event could be
 *    built for a camera.
 * 5. A `point` aim carrying `onHit` still performs: there is no single actor to
 *    recoil, the engine already withholds the react, and nothing changed
 *    there.
 * 6. Across every performing scenario, `shot.performances` never names a camera,
 *    the invariant the shot validator independently enforces.
