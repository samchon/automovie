/**
 * Pins the live-camera fallback: a shot with no `frame` call defaults to the
 * scene's first camera (staging already aimed it), and a scene with no cameras
 * at all cannot be framed.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. The performance has no `frame` action but staging rigged `cam-main` → success
 *    with `cam-main` live.
 * 2. Same performance against a staging with zero cameras → a `type` violation on
 *    `$input` (nothing can frame the take).
 * 3. The id this fallback picks becomes `shot.camera`, which the artifact contract
 *    requires to be non-empty. The other two routes to that field are already
 *    checked (a `frame` action through its actor, a coverage intent through its
 *    own id), so an unchecked fallback was the one way to assemble a shot the
 *    validator refuses (#1318). An empty first-camera id is refused, and the
 *    counter-case one property away, an empty id on a camera the fallback does
 *    NOT pick, still performs: the check follows the camera actually chosen
 *    rather than scanning the list.
