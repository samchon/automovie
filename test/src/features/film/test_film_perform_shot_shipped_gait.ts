/**
 * The plainest film performs: one actor, one shipped gait, no `region` (#1359).
 *
 * `locomote` carries the shipped counter-swing through its `fullBody` default.
 * Overlap safety follows the synthesized root/bones/expression rather than the
 * broad region label, so this gait layers with a head-only look but not an arm
 * gesture.
 *
 * It runs the real synthesizer rather than a stub, so the gait content under
 * test is the shipped content.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A region-less shipped walk performs with no violations.
 * 2. The compiled clip carries every leg and arm gait row.
 * 3. Every shipped gait behaves the same way: `walk`, `run`, `sprint`, `sneak` and
 *    `march` all perform under the default region.
 * 4. Locomote + lookAt layers, while locomote + wave is refused on the shared
 *    upper arm.
 * 5. A custom legs-only gait layers with the same wave.
 * 6. An explicit `lowerBody` override still reports the arm rows it would mask.
