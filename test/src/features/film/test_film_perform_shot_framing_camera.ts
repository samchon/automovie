/**
 * A camera the shot compiles a move FROM must be one the framing grammar can
 * solve.
 *
 * `stageScene` bounds a camera's field of view to (0, 180)° and its placement
 * to a finite point, but an EXPLICIT staged set never passes through staging,
 * and the framing solve divides by `tan(fovY / 2)`. A zero or NaN field of view
 * makes the framed distance infinite or NaN, so every keyframe the solve emits
 * is non-finite and `performShot` returns `success: true` with a clip the
 * artifact validator refuses at commit: the engine declaring a shot successful
 * that its own consumers cannot accept, the class #1224 and #1308 also belong
 * to.
 *
 * Both conditions (range, finiteness) are checked against both subjects (the
 * elected camera, each coverage camera), so each pairing carries its own case
 * rather than one combined probe.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. The positive floor: a valid camera compiles, and every emitted clip value is
 *    finite. That finiteness assertion is the contradiction this closes, so it
 *    is stated directly rather than inferred from success.
 * 2. The elected camera, refused on each condition at its own staged path: a zero
 *    field of view, NaN, the exclusive upper bound 180, a negative value, and a
 *    non-finite placement.
 * 3. The exclusive bounds are open, not clamped: 1e-6 and 179.999 still compile,
 *    so legitimate extreme lenses are not swept up by the gate.
 * 4. The same two conditions against a COVERAGE camera, which is a separate
 *    subject reached through a separate path.
 * 5. The rotation, which only a `whip` reads: it pans in place from the staged
 *    orientation, so that quaternion is pushed verbatim as the first keyframe
 *    while every other move derives its rotation through `lookRotation`. Both
 *    subjects are refused when they whip on a non-finite rotation, and both
 *    still compile with the same rotation under a non-whip move, which is what
 *    proves the check follows what the solve consumes rather than validating
 *    the whole transform (#1316). A valid whip emits only finite keyframes.
 * 6. The counter-case that keeps the gate narrow: a degenerate camera the shot
 *    never frames through is not checked. With no frame action at all the shot
 *    falls back to the first camera locked off, compiling no move, so even a
 *    degenerate elected camera is left alone.
