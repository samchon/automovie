/**
 * Staging may author the set's atmosphere, and the gate that accepts it is the
 * one the scene artifact applies downstream.
 *
 * Fog is a scene property, so `stage`, the rung that composes scenes, has to be
 * able to state one; otherwise the field is declarable in the schema and
 * unreachable from the only authoring path that builds a scene. Two facts carry
 * it and both are checked, because both fail silently rather than loudly: a
 * negative or non-finite `density` feeds `exp(-(density*d)^2)` a number the
 * shader paints as a dead frame, and an out-of-range color puts a horizon on
 * screen that no light in the scene could make.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A declared fog is lowered verbatim onto the composed scene.
 * 2. An omitted fog composes a scene with NO `fog` key, not `fog: null`: an
 *    atmosphere is something most sets do not have, and writing null onto every
 *    staged scene ever composed would change the bytes, and the content digest,
 *    of every production that never mentioned it.
 * 3. Each gate fires at the submitted field: a fog that is not an object, a
 *    negative density, a non-finite density, a density that is not a number, a
 *    color that is not an object, and a color component outside `[0, 1]`.
 * 4. The negative twin: a zero density is a vacuum and an enormous one is a wall
 *    of cloud. Both are looks, and neither is refused.
