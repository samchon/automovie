 * couplings with no violation.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A three-deep chain (sword ← rider ← horse ← walking dragon) bakes every link
 *    onto its parent's RIDDEN path: the sword's baked follow equals the
 *    hand-composed FK chain exactly, at the shot start and end.
 * 2. The whole chain carries the dragon's stride: the sword's net displacement is
 *    exactly the dragon's +2 m root travel (every other link is static).
 * 3. The pre-fix output is dead: the sword never sits at the composition onto the
 *    rider's staged decoy placement.
 * 4. A mount cycle (A rides B, B rides A) fails the shot with a violation naming
 *    the cycle: never a silent frozen bake.
 * 5. A mutual per-beat `attachTo` (A grabs B while B grabs A) fails the same way:
 *    the gate covers both coupling sources.
 * 6. A chained coupling whose intermediate parent has no rig still reports the
 *    existing mount-rig violation: the chain does not mask it.
