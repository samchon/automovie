/**
 * The workflow spine, end to end: one script's stage payloads flow through
 * every film-pipeline rung (stage the world, perform each beat into a shot, cut
 * the shots into a sequence) with every gate passing on the way. This is the
 * scenario the LLM harness will drive for real; here the stage payloads are
 * authored fixtures, which is exactly the point: the pipeline is deterministic
 * below the model.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A two-beat duel script stages into `scene-duel`, and each beat performs into
 *    its own shot (`shot:beat-1` with both knights moving, `shot:beat-2` with
 *    the champion celebrating): both ROM-validated against the stick skeleton.
 * 2. The cut plays beat-1 whole (2 s) then dissolves 0.5 s into a 1.5 s trim of
 *    beat-2 → a 24 fps sequence with runtime 2 + 1.5 − 0.5 = 3 s, every shot
 *    reference resolving to a built shot.
