/**
 * Distance, ground and pose queries resolve selectors, actors and terrain from
 * the compiled records they are handed, and refuse by name what those records
 * cannot answer.
 *
 * Every expected number is hand geometry. The shared humanoid's left hand rests
 * 0.75 m out and 1.4 m up in model space, which doubled in scale and turned a
 * quarter about +Y becomes 1.5 m toward -z and 2.8 m up; its head rests 1.7 m
 * up. The slope rises from one metre at z = 0 to five at z = 10.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Point, landmark, actor-root and actor-bone selectors measure 13, 10, 5 and
 *    zero metres, the bone through its actor's scale and turn; the same actor in
 *    another shot measures its head 1.7 m above its root.
 * 2. An object motion moves an actor's root along its path, and an absent sample
 *    time measures at zero.
 * 3. An invalid distance time, an absent landmark, a bone on an actor without a
 *    skeleton, an unresolved bone, an actor in several shots without a shot, an
 *    absent actor with and without a shot, and an actor whose model is absent
 *    each refuse by name.
 * 4. Ground under a point answers the first containing surface's height and
 *    walkability, and zero and not walkable over no surface or no world.
 * 5. A performed actor's root is its node plus the pose root at the performance's
 *    local time; a held actor reports its node, its authored pose, or an empty
 *    pose; a time outside the shot and a missing motion refuse.
