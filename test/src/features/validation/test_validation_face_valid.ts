 * Face trait weights are signed morph weights documented to [-2, 2]; a document

 * bound validates: the "valid face passes" baseline, pinning both limits so the
 * boundary itself is legal.
 *
 * Scenario: every singular leaf present, and the paired features exercising the
 * SIDE RULE's compositions: a lone left (mirrors to both eyes), two defined
 * sides (each its own brow), pair-level spacing plus a one-side offset, and a
 * lone right cheek; all in range, no violations.
