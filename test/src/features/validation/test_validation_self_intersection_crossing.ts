 * (0,0,-1) to (0,0,1). They cross at the origin, interior to both: the two
 * centerlines share a point, so the true distance is 0.
 *
 * Every capsule endpoint sits a full unit from the other centerline, so the
 * retired four-endpoint approximation measured this pair 1 m apart and the
 * forced self-intersection check passed it; the exact clamped solver reads the
