/**
 * The edit reads a staged set piece from the same box the camera was solved

 *
 * `filmGrammarDiagnostics` was the third and last independent measurement of a
 * subject: it stood the subject at the node's root translation and gave it the
 * model's vertical span and no width, while `performShot` framed and
 * `realizeShotContract` graded the drawn box carried through the same
 * placement. On the fixtures below the two disagreed by 30.000 m of horizontal
 * centre and a 30.017 m half-diagonal the read did not have at all (the
 * facade), and by 8.000 m of floor with a 6.708 m half-diagonal (the canopy
 * deck), which is how an author came to be told to move a camera the engine had
 * already solved.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A 60 m facade authored outward from its element origin, declared
 *    `medium`, framed by the camera the solve produces for it. The 60 m width
 *    is what places that camera, so nothing is wrong with the shot and no
 *    finding is filed.
 * 2. The same shot measured the way it was measured before: a mass 60 m wide
 *    and 24 m tall fills only 0.873 of the frame's height at a distance solved
 *    for its width, so the vertical read alone classified `full` and a
 *    `grammar-shot-size` warning told the author to move a camera that already
 *    delivered `medium`.
 * 3. A canopy whose 4 m deck hangs 8 m above its element origin, declared
 *    `medium`: the converged read files nothing.
 * 4. The same canopy measured at its origin classifies `full`, the second
 *    shape of the same divergence, with the floor as well as the width.
 * 5. A node whose model draws nothing keeps the point it always was: its rig
 *    span stands in for the height, its horizontal extent stays 0, and a
 *    `full` camera solved for that 6.000 m span is read as `full`, while the
 *    camera a 1.700 m stand-in would have produced is reported.
 * 6. A framing the solved camera genuinely does not deliver is still reported:
 *    the facade camera solved for `medium` under a declared `close` intent
 *    keeps the finding, so the convergence did not silence the check.
