 * The offline renderer reads the scene's atmosphere from the same declaration
 * the viewer hands the GPU, and derives the same number from it.
 *
 * A pose-conditioned host drives generation from the sidecar's screen
 * coordinates, and screen coordinates cannot say whether the subject standing
 * there is fully visible or a silhouette half-dissolved into haze. So each
 * actor now carries the transmittance at its own depth, through the engine's
 * one fog law rather than a renderer-local copy of it: a review frame and the
 * artifact beside it must not be able to disagree about the film.
 *
 * Scenarios (camera at the origin looking down −Z, one actor receding):
 *
 * 1. A scene declaring no fog omits the field entirely, so its serialized sidecar
 *    is byte-identical to one written before atmospheres existed: the key does
 *    not appear in the JSON at all.
 * 2. A declared fog attenuates the far frame more than the near one, and by the
 *    engine's exact law at each depth — the depth being the actor's live world
 *    root and not its staged placement, since the node sits at the origin for
 *    the whole shot and the clip carries all the travel. A sidecar keyed to the
 *    staged transform would report one atmosphere for both frames, and the
 *    transmittance of depth zero at that.
 * 3. Viewer and renderer agree: the `FogExp2` the viewer builds from this same
 *    scene, evaluated through the shader's own expression at the actor's depth,
 *    is the number the sidecar carries.
