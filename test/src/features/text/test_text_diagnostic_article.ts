/**
 * A diagnostic agrees with the value it interpolates, for every value.
 *
 * The messages here name a member of a closed union — a light type, an analysis
 * domain, a schedule subject, an action verb — and every one of those unions is
 * something this project keeps extending. A message that spells its article
 * beside the interpolation instead of deriving it reads correctly until the day
 * a vowel-initial member is added, and then reads `a opening` forever, in the
 * gap and violation text an author consults to decide what is wrong. That is
 * where it was found: `a opening row states type, size and count but no place`,
 * in a benchmark sandbox's `building.log`, in two separate rounds.
 *
 * So the property under test is not the wording of any one message. It is that
 * a union can grow without producing broken prose, and the cases are built to
 * fail when it cannot:
 *
 * - The light and domain tables are keyed by the runtime union constants, so a
 *   new member leaves the table incomplete and the case says so.
 * - The verb table is `satisfies Record<IAutoMovieActionCall["verb"], string>`,
 *   so a new verb fails the compile instead — the verbs have no runtime
 *   constant to enumerate, and the type checker enumerates them.
 * - Each table states its article as a literal rather than calling the helper
 *   the product uses, so a case cannot agree with a broken helper.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Every light type, staged so it trips the parameter refusals that name the
 *    type. `area` is the vowel-initial member and the reason this case exists;
 *    the other three are the counter-case a blanket `an` would fail.
 * 2. Every analysis domain, required with nothing submitted, in both the gap's
 *    reason and its remedy. Three of the six begin with a vowel.
 * 3. Both schedule subjects that owe a location, and the third subject that
 *    does not, because the article and that guard sit on one statement.
 * 4. The two vowel-initial action verbs against a camera actor, with a
 *    consonant-initial verb as the counter-case.
