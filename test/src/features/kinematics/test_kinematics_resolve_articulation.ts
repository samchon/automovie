 * propagates into its children's world positions.
 *
 * Scenario: twist the chest 90° about +Y. The chest's own local rotation
 * becomes Y90, and its child the leftUpperArm, whose rest offset is the local
 * +X vector (0.2,0,0), swings a quarter turn to −Z, so its world position moves
 * from (0.2,1.4,0) at rest to (0,1.4,−0.2).
