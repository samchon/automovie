/**
 * The arm kinematics assume the VRM T-pose rest convention, and a rig that
 * rests otherwise loses its elbow entirely (#1346).
 *
 * `HUMANOID_JOINT_AXES` maps the arm's `flexion` onto local **+Y** because a
 * T-pose arm points along local X, so flexion swings it sagittally instead of
 * rolling it. Applied to an arm that HANGS along local −Y, that same table
 * names the bone's own long axis: elbow flexion becomes a roll, the hand does
 * not move at all, and the arm is a rigid stick. Nothing refused such a rig.
 * `forge` accepted it, no validator inspects a rest direction, and `getReach`
 * answered `reachable: true` with a pose that loaded abduction and twist onto
 * axes the rig declared immobile, because on that rig those were the only axes
 * that could bend the arm at all.
 *
 * The refusal belongs at the point of USE, not at authoring time: the humanoid
 * bone enum is the only vocabulary the surface has, so a retargeted quadruped's
 * front legs ride the arm chains and legitimately rest along −Y. A blanket
 * `forge` refusal would forbid every quadruped, including the one the benchmark
 * corpus shipped successfully. The test is therefore rig-shaped rather than a
 * convention sniff: is the elbow's flexion axis parallel to the forearm's rest
 * direction?
 *
 * The expected spans below are hand-computed, not sampled from the code: an
 * elbow rolling about the forearm's own axis cannot change the shoulder-to-hand
 * distance, so it stays `0.32 + 0.28 = 0.600000` at EVERY angle, while a T-pose
 * elbow closes the triangle by the law of cosines, `sqrt(0.32² + 0.28² −
 * 2·0.32·0.28·cos(180° − flexion))`.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. The degeneracy, measured: on the arms-down rig the shoulder-to-hand span is
 *    `0.600000` at every elbow flexion in the sweep. The elbow does nothing.
 * 2. NEGATIVE TWIN: the same sweep on the T-pose rig matches the law of cosines at
 *    every angle and falls from `0.600000` to `0.160026`, so the sweep itself
 *    is a working measurement rather than a constant.
 * 3. `armChainFault` names the arms-down rig's elbow, and returns `null` for the
 *    T-pose rig: the diagnosis matches the measurement on both sides.
 * 4. `reachPose` refuses the arms-down rig rather than returning a pose whose bend
 *    rides axes the rig declares immobile, and still solves the T-pose rig.
 * 5. Boundary, per SIDE not per rig: a rig with one arm T-posed and the other
 *    hanging is faulted on exactly the hanging side.
 * 6. Boundary, nothing to diagnose: a rig with no hand bone is not a convention
 *    fault, it is a missing chain, and the two answers stay distinct.
 * 7. Boundary, an ill-posed question: a zero-length forearm has no direction to be
 *    parallel to, and an axis table that names no elbow hinge (or names a
 *    zero-length one) states no convention to break. None is a fault.
