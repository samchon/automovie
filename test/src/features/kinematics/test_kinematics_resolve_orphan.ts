/**
 * The core #730 scenario: a skeleton with a real root and a reachable sub-tree,
 * plus ONE orphaned bone whose parent names a bone absent from the skeleton.
 * `resolvePose` resolves the reachable bones and **omits the orphan** (the
 * partial-return contract), so a consumer that reads a specific bone must gate
 * on {@link reachableBoneNames} to notice the orphan rather than trusting the
 * `skeleton.bones` declared set. This pins that the reachable-set query and the
 * FK walk agree exactly on which bones are present.
 *
 * `hips`(root)→`spine`→`chest` are reachable; `leftHand`→`leftLowerArm` is
 * orphaned (`leftLowerArm` is not declared).
