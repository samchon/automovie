/**
 * `reachPose`: analytic two-bone arm IK. The contract is the FK oracle: pose
 * the skeleton with the returned angles and the hand lands on the target. Any
 * error in the shoulder/elbow solve or the quaternion→clinical lowering shows
 * up as a hand that misses, so this pins correctness end to end regardless of
 * the convention details.
 *
 * The fixture's left arm runs shoulder (0.2, 1.4, 0) → elbow → hand with
 * segments 0.3 + 0.25 = 0.55 m of reach.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Several reachable targets around the shoulder (forward, down, across, up):
 *    the resolved left hand lands on each within tolerance.
 * 2. A target beyond the 0.55 m reach extends the arm fully toward it: the hand
 *    lands on the shoulder→target ray at exactly reach distance (on the shell,
 *    not past it, not failing).
 * 3. A missing arm chain (the fixture has no rightHand) returns null; a target on
 *    the shoulder returns null (degenerate); a zero-length arm bone (a
 *    malformed rig) returns null instead of dividing by zero.
 * 4. A target straight below the shoulder still lands. This was the case that used
 *    to need the bend-plane fallback, because the reach axis ran parallel to
 *    the world-down pole the plane was derived from. Since #1345 the arm bends
 *    in the elbow's own hinge plane, so no pole and no fallback are involved;
 *    the case is kept because the axis-aligned target is still the one most
 *    likely to expose a degenerate cross product.
