/**
 * `reachPose` must return a pose the rig can actually hold (#1345).
 *
 * The analytic solve used to articulate the mid joint as a free swing,
 * `aimRotation(localFore, localGoal)`, which generically decomposes into
 * abduction and twist. An elbow declares those axes immobile, so the pose was
 * illegal BY CONSTRUCTION, and the bend plane came from a world-down pole that
 * is right for a knee and bends an elbow backwards. On the canonical humanoid
 * under the engine's own `DEFAULT_HUMANOID_ROM`, exactly one of eight targets
 * came back ROM-clean and that one was the rest pose itself, while a grid
 * search proved valid poses exist for five of the seven failures.
 *
 * The expectations here are taken from the CONTRACT, never from what the solver
 * emits: an elbow's immobile axes must read exactly `0` because that is what
 * `IAutoMovieJointConstraint` means by a `null` axis, the hand must land on the
 * target because that is what an IK solve is for, and the verdict is
 * `validatePose`'s own, so the solver cannot grade itself by a kinder rule than
 * its gate.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Positive: each of the five witnessed targets returns a pose `validatePose`
 *    accepts with zero violations, and the hand lands within 1e-4 m.
 * 2. The hinge invariant, which is the mechanism rather than the symptom: the
 *    elbow's abduction and twist are EXACTLY zero for every one of those poses,
 *    so the axes an elbow does not have carry no rotation at all.
 * 3. The two targets the existence search could not settle are also clean, so the
 *    fix is not scoped to the rows that had a witness.
 * 4. Boundary, the rest-pose target: the identity articulation, zero violations,
 *    with the shoulder reading its clinical rest of 90 degrees abduction.
 * 5. Boundary, out of shell: a target four times the arm's length lands the hand
 *    on the 0.55 m shell along the shoulder-to-target ray, still ROM-clean.
 * 6. NEGATIVE TWIN: a fused elbow (`flexion` pinned to `[0, 0]`) cannot reach a
 *    target off its one span, so the verdict is still a refusal with the
 *    flexion axis named. The gate did not become permissive.
