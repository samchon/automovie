/**
 * The rest-frame angle maps that let a pose be authored in one **clinical**
 * convention (e.g. +abduction raises either arm) while the rig articulates in
 * its own per-side rest-relative space: `jointToQuaternion` reads clinical and
 * maps in (`r = (c − neutral) / sign`), `decomposeJointRotation` lifts the
 * recovered rig angle back out (`c = sign·r + neutral`).
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. `toRigAngle` / `toClinicalAngle` are inverses; a `null` angle and an absent
 *    frame both pass through as the identity.
 * 2. Feeding `jointToQuaternion` a clinical angle with a frame equals feeding it
 *    the pre-converted rig angle with no frame.
 * 3. `decompose(jointToQuaternion(c, axes, f), axes, f)` round-trips the clinical
 *    angles, including the gimbal case (abduction at the rig's ±90°).
 * 4. `resolvePose` threads the frame: a clinical pose resolved with the humanoid
 *    frames lands the hand where the pre-converted rig pose does without them.
 * 5. `reachPose` threads the frame: the raw rig-space answer must now be asked for
 *    explicitly with an empty table. Each frame's pose lands the hand on the
 *    target when read in its own space, and the elbow's hinge angle is
 *    identical across frames because the target distance alone sets it. The two
 *    SHOULDER solutions are not a fixed offset apart: the solver picks its
 *    swivel by ROM legality, judged in the declared space, so a frame selects a
 *    different exact solution rather than renaming one (#1345).
 * 6. Omitting `restFrames` takes the canonical humanoid frame rather than raw rig
 *    space, so the arm verbs and the reach oracle answer one rig in ONE space
 *    (#1346). The negative twin is scenario 5's explicit `{}`, which still
 *    produces the rig-space angles a caller with its own convention needs.
