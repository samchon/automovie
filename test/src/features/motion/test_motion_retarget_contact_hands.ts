/**
 * A hand contact is preserved only where the caller declares it, because a hand
 * has no ground to be judged against.
 *
 * A foot's contact is inferable: it is the effector sitting on the ground
 * plane. A hand resting on a table, braced on a wall, or gripping a partner is
 * geometrically indistinguishable from a hand in the air, so inferring one
 * would be a guess. The retarget therefore pins a hand only across a declared
 * window, and leaves every other frame's arm exactly as authored.
 *
 * The target rig differs from the source only in arm length (1.3x), so the leg
 * contacts stay proportional and every observed change is the arm's.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Without a declaration, the 1.3x arm carries its angles verbatim and the left
 *    hand misses the mapped source contact by the full rest-length difference:
 *    0.2177, the hand-derived distance between (0.923, 1.645, 0) and (0.71,
 *    1.6, 0).
 * 2. Declaring the left-arm chain over the whole clip pins the hand back onto the
 *    mapped source contact within 0.005, on both keyframes, with no
 *    plausibility warning.
 * 3. A window that falls between the authored keyframe times pins nothing, so the
 *    clip is deep-equal to the undeclared retarget: the window bounds are
 *    inclusive tests against real keyframe times, not a hint.
 * 4. A declaration naming bones the target rig does not have is skipped rather
 *    than half-solved, and the retarget still succeeds.
