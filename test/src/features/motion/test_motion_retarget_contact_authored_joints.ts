/**
 * The contact correction rewrites only the pinned limb's own two joints,
 * replacing what the clip authored on them and leaving every other authored
 * joint exactly as written.
 *
 * A pose is **sparse** (only bones that leave rest appear), so a correction
 * cannot simply append its result: appending would leave two entries for the
 * same bone, and whichever the FK walk read last would silently win. The pass
 * therefore drops the chain's own entries before adding the solved ones, which
 * is also why an authored knee angle is not blended with the solved one: the
 * contact is the constraint, and the limb that reaches it is derived.
 *
 * The clip here authors a spine bend plus a bent left leg, and a generous
 * contact tolerance keeps the articulated feet inside the contact band so the
 * correction actually runs.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. The corrected pose names each bone exactly once: the two authored leg joints
 *    are replaced, not duplicated, and both right-leg joints are added.
 * 2. The authored spine joint is carried through untouched, angles and all.
 * 3. The authored left-leg angles are gone: the solved knee differs from the 12
 *    degrees the clip wrote.
 * 4. The point of the rewrite holds: the left foot ends on the mapped source
 *    contact within 0.005, which the authored angles alone missed.
