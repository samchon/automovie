/**
 * A contact the target rig cannot physically hold is reported as a warning, not
 * a failure: residual foot slide is implausible, not impossible.
 *
 * The rig pair is the same legs-1.5x / torso-0.9x target as the tracking case,
 * but now under the **default** humanoid ROM, whose hip gamut stops at 120
 * degrees of flexion and -30 of extension. Folding a leg that long under the
 * mapped contact needs more than the gamut allows, so the clamped chain stops
 * short. The retarget still returns a clip: the correction that the ROM did
 * permit is kept, the residual is measured, and the shortfall surfaces as
 * advice the harness can accept or act on.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. The retarget succeeds (`validation.success` is true and `motion` is non-null)
 *    while carrying one `physics` warning per foot, located on the keyframe and
 *    effector that missed by the most.
 * 2. The residual it warns about is real: the pinned foot still misses its mapped
 *    contact by more than the 0.02 * rootScale contact budget.
 * 3. The clamped correction is still an improvement, not damage: the pinned foot
 *    ends closer to the mapped contact than the verbatim angle copy does.
 * 4. Widening `contacts.tolerance` widens the same budget, so the identical
 *    residual stops being worth reporting and the run comes back clean.
