/**
 * A frame with no contact is retargeted exactly as v1 did, so the pass narrows
 * to the frames a contact actually constrains.
 *
 * Contact is what makes a proportion mismatch visible: a foot on the ground has
 * a world position the audience can see slide, while a foot in the air only has
 * the joint angles the author wrote. Correcting an airborne limb toward a
 * mapped position would overwrite authored intent for no observable gain, so
 * detection gates the correction frame by frame rather than clip by clip.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A clip whose second keyframe lifts the root a full unit leaves the feet above
 *    the source rig's floor plus tolerance, so only the grounded first keyframe
 *    is corrected and the airborne one keeps its empty authored pose.
 * 2. Declaring a ground plane far below the rig removes every contact, and the
 *    corrected clip becomes deep-equal to the verbatim angle copy: the
 *    no-contact boundary.
 * 3. A single-keyframe clip is rejected by the clip validator, not by a crash
 *    inside the contact pass, and returns a field-located temporal violation.
