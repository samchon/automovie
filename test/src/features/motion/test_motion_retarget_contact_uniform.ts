/**
 * A uniformly scaled target makes the contact-preserving pass a mathematical
 * no-op, which is what lets it default to on without touching any clip that was
 * already exact.
 *
 * Every forward-kinematics position on a rig whose rest offsets are all
 * multiplied by `s` is exactly `s` times its source counterpart, and the root
 * path is scaled by the same `s`, so the mapped contact and the resolved
 * effector coincide to the last bit. The pass measures that drift before
 * solving anything and skips the frame, so the corrected clip is not merely
 * close to the uncorrected one: it is equal.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Both feet are in contact on every keyframe of the clip (the whole-clip
 *    contact boundary), so the pass has a pin on each frame and still changes
 *    nothing.
 * 2. The retarget with the pass on returns a clip deep-equal to the same retarget
 *    with `contacts.enabled === false`, and no joint is added to the poses the
 *    source left empty.
 * 3. The run succeeds with zero plausibility warnings, and the target feet sit
 *    exactly on `rootScale` times the source contacts.
