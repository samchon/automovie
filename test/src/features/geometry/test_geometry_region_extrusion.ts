 * Free-form extrusion, and with it the arbitrary-shape host opening.
 *
 * Every volume here is the region's hand-computed area times the depth, and
 * every area is closed-form rather than sampled: an L of legs 3x1 and 1x2 is 5
 * m², a semicircular arch on a 1.2 m chord is its rectangle plus eight isoceles
 * triangles of apex angle pi/8, and a twelve-sided oculus of radius 0.5 m is
 * exactly 0.75 m². The wall builder can cut none of these, and the convex
 * extrusion refuses all of them.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A concave L extrudes to a closed prism of `area * depth`, with the vertex and
 *    index counts a flat-shaded prism owns, while the convex extrusion still
 *    refuses the same profile: the escape hatch did not loosen the old gate.
 * 2. Normals and UVs are pinned by hand on the +Z cap and on the first side quad:
 *    the cap carries its own profile coordinates against +Z, and the side
 *    carries distance travelled along the ring against height.
 * 3. An arched opening and a round oculus each cut a real hole through a wall
 *    panel, closed and 2-manifold, of exactly the panel less the opening.
 * 4. An opening that reaches the floor is a concave outer ring rather than a hole,
 *    and closes to the same kind of solid.
 * 5. A hollow tube: the section's void runs the whole depth and the walls close
 *    around it.
 * 6. The -Z cap mirrors its V coordinate so its atlas reads from outside.
 * 7. The pinched shape `buildAutoMovieWall` refuses is refused here too, so the
 *    free-form path is not the way around a solid that touches itself.
 * 8. Determinism, and the refusal of a non-positive depth.
