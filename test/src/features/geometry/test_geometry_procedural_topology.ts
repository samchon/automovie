/**
 * A closed solid must be provably closed, and an assembly must not be able to
 * pass as one.
 *
 * Nothing in this kernel is allowed to claim watertightness it did not earn, so
 * the check is the 2-manifold oracle: weld vertices by position, then demand
 * that every non-degenerate edge is used by exactly two triangles. That single
 * measure separates the three cases a builder actually produces — a closed
 * prism, an intentionally open surface, and members that share a face — and the
 * divergence-theorem volume is the independent second witness, exact for a
 * closed polyhedron and zero for a flat patch.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. An extruded prism and a face-authored ridged solid are both watertight, with
 *    volumes equal to their hand-computed `w·h·d` and `w·h·d/2`.
 * 2. A single triangle is an open surface: three boundary edges, not watertight,
 *    zero volume.
 * 3. Three triangles sharing one edge report that edge as non-manifold, while a
 *    cut wall closes into one solid: it drops the face between every adjacent
 *    pair of standing cells, so it emits exactly the 32 outward quads its
 *    lattice leaves and no interior wall a camera could never reach.
 * 4. A collapsed triangle is counted as degenerate and contributes no edges.
 * 5. Non-finite positions, normals, and uvs are all counted; an attribute-free
 *    mesh counts none of them.
 * 6. Corners spelled a picosecond of a metre apart weld into one, so a builder
 *    that recomputes a seam is still closed.
 * 7. An empty mesh is not watertight, because no edges is not the same as no
 *    holes.
 * 8. Negative twins: an empty face list, a two-corner face, a non-finite corner, a
 *    collinear face, a reflex face, and a self-intersecting bow-tie face are
 *    each refused, as is a non-planar face.
 * 9. A mesh at 2^26 vertices is refused with the limit named, since a packed
 *    pair of welded ids is unique only below it.
