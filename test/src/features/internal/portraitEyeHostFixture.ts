/**
 * Independent tilted orbital patch for complete eye-component scenarios.
 * The host is the plane Z=X/4 in head millimetres: a 20-by-6 mm diamond
 * aperture, its centre, and a 60-by-60 mm surrounding square. Four centre
 * triangles supply the removable opening; eight annular triangles supply the
 * shared skin. Every triangle faces +Z, so the outer square remains a free rim.
 * The aperture plane differs from the axial observation ray deliberately;
 * comparing the two sphere-fit modes must therefore exercise distinct frames.
 * Each invocation owns its arrays. No photographed landmark, named subject or
 * fitted identity profile participates, and the patch is not a whole cranium.
 * The left-eye variant reflects X and reverses triangle winding. Its socket
 * lists are also reversed to retain the component's increasing-head-X boundary
 * convention; reflecting positions alone would select the exterior region.
