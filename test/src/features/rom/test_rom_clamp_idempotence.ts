/**
 * ROM clamping must be **idempotent**: clamping an already-clamped pose changes
 * nothing. If it were not, a second validation/clamp pass could drift a pose
 * that the first pass called settled, the fixed point the "clamp then validate"
 * contract assumes. A property sweep over wild random poses (every axis far
 * past its limit) exercises the clamp on every branch, which a few hand poses
 * cannot.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Over 200 seeded wild poses, `clampPose(clampPose(p)) === clampPose(p)`
 *    exactly: one clamp reaches the fixed point.
 * 2. Non-vacuity: a wild pose is actually changed by the first clamp, so the
 *    idempotence check is exercising the clamp path, not comparing two no-ops.
 * 3. A pose already inside ROM passes through clamping unchanged.
