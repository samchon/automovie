/**
 * Detect and enforce must be one calculation: `validateJointRom` used to skip
 * `angle === 0` unconditionally, but a per-bone override may legally EXCLUDE
 * zero (`flexion: [10, 90]`, only min ≤ max is enforced), and `clampJointRom`
 * moves that 0 to the min. Validation calling the authored 0 clean while the
 * clamp rewrites it broke the pair's contract (#1057). The zero skip exists
 * only for the IMMOBILE axis, where 0 is that axis's rest.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Flexion 0 against a zero-excluding `[10, 90]` override reports a `rom`
 *    violation at the axis path, and `clampJointRom` moves the same input to 10
 *    (clamp/validate parity).
 * 2. Zero on an immobile (`null`) axis of the same constraint stays clean, and a
 *    zero against a zero-INCLUDING range stays clean: the skip survives exactly
 *    where it is correct.
