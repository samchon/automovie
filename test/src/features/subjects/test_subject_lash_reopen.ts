/**
 * Opening from a partly closed observation reverses lash transport; gaze is
 * not a substitute for lid motion. An independent mirrored orbital plane
 * supplies the attachment without a photographed person's configuration.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 * 1. Matching observed/current closure with a nonzero gaze leaves the authored
 *    straight lash anterior, at its final attached root.
 * 2. Reopening the same observation turns the lash upwards and keeps its root
 *    distinct from the reference root; the other eye is not constructed here.
