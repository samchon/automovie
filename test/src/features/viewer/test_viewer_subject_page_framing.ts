/**
 * A subject named by key is framed from the box its contents fill, not from
 * the box a room was declared over.
 *
 * The test resolves a key through `describeAutoMovieSubject`, takes the
 * description's content box, and passes it to `frameAutoMovieViewerSubject`.
 * It measures the public query-to-camera chain directly: the named subject
 * determines the framing, and its full content box stays inside the picture.
 * No scaffold page or browser entry point is required by this unit test.
 *
 * The declared box is the trap, and it is a trap because it is plausible. A
 * space is authored as a convex cell and its contents fill some other extent
 * inside it; reading the first as the second aims the eye at a point where
 * nothing stands, which is how three of four cameras in one survey framed a
 * wall (samchon/automovie#1920). Choosing content over declared is therefore
 * not a preference, and the two ways the wrong choice shows are measured
 * rather than described: the aim moves, and the subject shrinks.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. The two boxes of one room genuinely disagree, so the choice between them
 *    is a real choice.
 * 2. Every planned viewpoint, at a landscape and a portrait viewport, contains
 *    the whole content box inside the frustum — side planes, near and far.
 * 3. Framing the declared cell instead moves the aim point off the contents
 *    and shrinks what the reviewer is looking at.
 * 4. Where the contents overflow their own cell, the declared framing does not
 *    merely shrink them: it crops them out of the picture.
 * 5. A room with nothing in it reports no content box, and the declared cell
 *    is what is left to frame.
 * 6. A fixed downward ring puts the eye under the ground for a room and not
 *    for a slate on a roof, and the eye's height rises with the angle, which
 *    is what makes one grounded angle per subject well defined.
 * 7. Compiled ids resolve from subject keys; a prototype reports model-space
 *    bounds rather than pretending to be a placed world-space subject.
