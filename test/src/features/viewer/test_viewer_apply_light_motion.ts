/**
 * The render side of the light-time axis (#1348): a shot's `lightMotions`
 * reaches the `three.js` lights that play them.
 *
 * This is the acceptance's "consumer, not just contract" half. #1339 was a
 * validated artifact with no applier, so the axis is only real if something
 * downstream of `getShot` writes the sampled value; here that is
 * `applyLightMotion` over the id index `buildScene` publishes.
 *
 * Expected values are the artifact's own, converted by the documented units:
 * `range` is `three.js`'s `distance` in metres, and `coneAngle` is a HALF-angle
 * in degrees against `three.js`'s radians, so 40° is `40π/180`. The intensity
 * at the cue comes from the glTF STEP rule (`v_k` for `t_k <= t`) and the
 * midpoint values from linear interpolation at the exact centre of a `[1.2,
 * 2.0]` segment, the same oracles the engine pass is held to.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. `buildScene` publishes its lights by ID and still adds them as top-level
 *    children in staging order — the mask palette is keyed by that index, so
 *    the id map has to be an addition rather than a reordering.
 * 2. A staged light lands with its authored values (the point light's colour,
 *    intensity, and `distance`; the spot's cone in radians), which is what
 *    makes the "before" of the next scenario a measured value and not an
 *    assumption.
 * 3. At `t = 1.6` the candle reads 0.04 and the segment midpoint colour `(0.5,
 *    0.4, 0.25)`, and the lamp's cone has opened to 70°: the clips drove the
 *    `three.js` lights, on the ids they named.
 * 4. Two halves of one call. A light the host does not resolve is skipped, not
 *    thrown at (the engine already refused a clip naming an unstaged light, so
 *    an unresolved one here is a host that built part of the scene). A light no
 *    clip addresses is written back to its STAGED value, which is where this
 *    helper deliberately differs from `applyObjectMotion`: a light carries its
 *    own rest on the scene, so the viewer's lighting can be a pure function of
 *    scene, clips and time instead of depending on what the previous frame left
 *    behind.
