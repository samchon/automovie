/**
 * A scene's `space` is drawn (#1173). The surfaces were already the engine's
 * semantic ground while nothing rendered them, so a depth or mask pass of a
 * staged scene showed actors over a void: the only ground anywhere was a
 * `GridHelper`, and a grid is a `LineSegments` that every structural pass hides
 * first (#1226). Building the surfaces as real meshes is the whole fix: the
 * passes collect geometry as `traverse` ∩ `isMesh`, so the ground joins them
 * with no pass-side change.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A one-floor space adds a `__automovie_space` group holding one mesh named for
 *    the surface, appended AFTER the nodes and lights so the mask palette's
 *    top-level child indexing leaves every node's color where it was.
 * 2. The floor faces UP: its four-vertex footprint fans into two triangles, and
 *    both right-hand face normals are +Y: the winding a single-sided override
 *    material needs in order to draw at all (the counter-clockwise XZ hull fans
 *    to −Y, so the fan is deliberately reversed).
 * 3. A ramp lifts each vertex to its own interpolated height: over a 2 m axis
 *    climbing 1 m, every vertex sits at `x / 2` and every face normal is the
 *    hand-computed plane normal `(-1, 2, 0)/√5`.
 * 4. Heightfield relief is tessellated at its internal lattice, not flattened to
 *    the footprint corners.
 * 5. A collinear footprint encloses no area and contributes no mesh, so a
 *    degenerate surface never reaches the GPU as invalid geometry.
 * 6. Both sides of the absent-space branch: `null` and an omitted field add no
 *    group, leaving the pre-space scene byte-for-byte as it was.
 * 7. A structural pass really does pick the ground up: the depth override swaps
 *    the ground mesh's material along with the actor's, which is exactly what
 *    the hidden grid never allowed.
