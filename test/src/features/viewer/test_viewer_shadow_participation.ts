/**
 * A built scene says which objects cast a shadow and which receive one.
 *
 * Every other link of the chain was already built and none of them produced a
 * shadow. `stageScene` validates a light's `castShadow` and refuses shadow
 * settings without it; the render inventory counts `shadowMaps` as
 * `casters.length` and a render budget constrains that count; the scaffold's
 * own example declares `shadows: { enabled: true, type: "pcfSoft" }`;
 * `buildLight` applies the flag and the entire shadow camera — map size, bias,
 * normal bias, near and far; `applySceneEnvironment` enables
 * `renderer.shadowMap` from the scene's declaration and restores the prior
 * state afterwards. `receiveShadow` appeared nowhere in the repository, and
 * `castShadow` only ever on a light. `three.js` needs an enabled map, a casting
 * light **and** participating geometry, so every production that declared a
 * caster rendered none.
 *
 * The absence does not look like one. A `#1954` benchmark authored a fascia and
 * soffit band with a deliberate dark recess above the wall; the darkening reads
 * as a shadow in every captured frame and is nothing but geometry and material
 * response to light direction. Building the appearance out of geometry is what
 * an author reaches for when the mechanism is missing and no gate says so.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A model's parts both cast and receive. They are the solids in the scene,
 *    and a solid that occludes nothing is the defect this closes.
 * 2. A standable surface neither casts nor receives. It is a semantic patch
 *    reserved for structural guide passes, not beauty geometry; receiving a
 *    shadow would promote the declaration back into the delivered image, while
 *    casting from a volume-free plane produces depth acne rather than a shadow.
 * 3. Non-mesh renderables are untouched. A grid helper, a line, a point cloud
 *    and a sprite carry the same `castShadow` field and mean nothing by it, so
 *    a rule that set every `Object3D` would silently claim they participate.
 * 4. The pass is idempotent and reapplicable by a host that assembles its own
 *    graph — the playground's film page, which is what the offline renderer
 *    captures. Running it twice changes nothing, and running it on a graph
 *    built elsewhere reaches the meshes added after `buildScene` returned.
