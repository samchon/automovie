 * Scene fog (`IAutoMovieScene.fog`): the depth cue an exterior needs, declared
 * once and read the same way by everything that reads it.
 *
 * Before this the only way to suggest distance was to spend the particle budget
 * on alpha billboards standing in for haze, capped at 4,096 per recipe: on open
 * ground every surface read at the same remove, because nothing in the scene
 * said how far anything was. Fog costs no particles, applies to every drawn
 * surface, and is one declaration for the whole scene.
 *
 * The law is exactly the renderer's own, `T(d) = exp(-(density*d)^2)`, so the
 * number an offline consumer computes IS the number the GPU painted rather than
 * an approximation of it. This test holds the two together from both ends: the
 * viewer's built `FogExp2` and the engine's `sceneFogTransmittance` must agree
 * at every depth, and the shader's own expression, written out here from
 * `fog_fragment.glsl`, must agree with both.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Absent is absent, and absent clears: a scene that says nothing about fog, and
 *    one that says `null`, both leave `scene.fog` unset, which is `three.js`'s
 *    own no-fog and therefore byte-identical to every frame rendered before the
 *    field existed — and a scene ALREADY carrying an atmosphere loses it, which
 *    is the half a fresh scene cannot show, since it constructs with no fog
 *    whether the call runs or not. The engine agrees, returning a transmittance
 *    of exactly one.
 * 2. A declared fog reaches the renderer verbatim: the density is the authored
 *    number and the color is the authored linear triple, unconverted.
 * 3. Viewer and engine derive the same value from the same declaration, at every
 *    depth and to the shader's own formula; the half-visibility distance is
 *    where `IAutoMovieFog` says it is, and twice that distance is where the
 *    SQUARED exponent puts it rather than where a plain Beer-Lambert falloff
 *    would.
 * 4. Distance is what fog reads: a subject twice as far keeps less of itself,
 *    monotonically, and is all but gone across the far plane.
 * 5. Structural guide passes suspend it and put it back: a mask must not tint its
 *    palette with distance, and the beauty pass, which IS the film, keeps it.
