/**
 * The viewer and the renderer derive the SAME direction, at build time and at
 * every frame after it.
 *
 * `buildLight` places a light once; `applyLightMotion` resolves the scene's
 * lights, clips and frame time through the engine on each update. Both write
 * through `applyLightState`. The parity risk is between initial construction
 * and subsequent animation, not between a viewer page and a deleted scaffold
 * runtime. The light must follow its animated transform rather than keep
 * facing the direction in which it was first staged.
 *
 * `three.js` does not shine an aimed light along its quaternion; it shines from
 * its position toward its `target`, so the rendered direction is measured the
 * way the renderer actually computes it, from world positions, and compared
 * against the artifact's own local −Z carried by the resolved rotation.
 * Anything that agreed on the quaternion but disagreed on the aim would still
 * be caught.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A staged light built with `buildLight` alone already shines where the
 *    artifact says, so the build path needs no animation to be correct.
 * 2. At the start, the midpoint and the end of the swing, the direction the
 *    `three.js` light shines equals the direction the engine resolved — the
 *    frame follows the declaration rather than the staging.
 * 3. The frame is right, not merely self-consistent: the animated lamp's direction
 *    is what `three.js`' own interpolation of the clip's two keys gives, so
 *    nothing in the engine is on both sides of the comparison. A
 *    build-against-animate check would not say this — both paths reduce to one
 *    `applyLightState` call, and a resolve reading the clip wrongly would carry
 *    them together.
