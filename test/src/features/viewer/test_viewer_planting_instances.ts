/**
 * A planting cluster is drawn as GPU-instanced batches whose matrices are the
 * lossless composition of the member's transform with the branch's or leaf's
 * own.
 *
 * Repetition must never become scene nodes. A bed of six ferns is two draws —
 * one batch of branches and one of leaves — and the instance count is exactly
 * `members × parts`, which is the whole reason the engine derives one prototype
 * structure and a list of placements instead of duplicating geometry.
 *
 * Losslessness is the second half of the contract. Decomposing an instance's
 * matrix must return the member's own translation, its unit quaternion and its
 * three independent scale axes, composed with the part's: a degraded yaw or a
 * uniform scale would be a fact about the plant nobody authored. The comparison
 * is made to single-precision tolerance because `InstancedMesh` stores its
 * matrices as 32-bit floats — that rounding is the GPU's, not the derivation's,
 * and the reference values on the engine side stay double precision.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. The group holds exactly two instanced meshes, with instance counts equal to
 *    `members × branches` and `members × leaves`.
 * 2. The first branch instance decomposes to the first member's transform composed
 *    with the branch's own: the midpoint of the trunk, the rotation carrying
 *    `+y` onto the trunk axis, and the mean radius by the length.
 * 3. The first leaf instance is, element for element, the member's matrix times
 *    the leaf's own — and the leaf's own matrix round-trips back to exactly the
 *    translation, unit quaternion and per-axis scale the derivation emitted.
 *    The composed matrix deliberately does **not** decompose back to the
 *    product of the two scales: a per-axis parent scale composed with a rotated
 *    child is a sheared transform, which is why the check is on the matrix
 *    rather than on a decomposition that would have to invent a rotation for
 *    it.
 * 4. Every instance matrix is finite and every batch reports a bounding sphere, so
 *    nothing is culled against an unset volume.
 * 5. A branch the envelope cut to nothing keeps its instance slot and collapses to
 *    a zero-height cylinder, rather than being skipped — which would shift
 *    every later branch's index — or drawn with an undefined axis.
 * 6. A bare structure with no foliage rule produces no leaf batch at all rather
 *    than an empty one, and disposing releases what the object created while
 *    leaving a borrowed material alone.
 * 7. A structure that never emerged draws nothing: the batch is hidden and its
 *    bounding sphere is a point, rather than the empty sphere of radius
 *    `-Infinity` that computing bounds over zero instances would leave for a
 *    camera to cull against.
