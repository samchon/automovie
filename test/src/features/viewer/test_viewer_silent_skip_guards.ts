/**
 * Two viewer paths used to drop caller data in silence (#1051):
 *
 * 1. `buildScene` skipped a node whose model id could not resolve, and the
 *    segmentation mask palette is keyed by top-level child INDEX, so every
 *    later node shifted one color over and a mask consumer attributed pixels to
 *    the wrong node. Unresolvable caller data now throws, the same class as
 *    `buildModel`'s missing skin bone.
 * 2. `applyPose` dropped articulation for any bone missing from the model's bone
 *    map with no trace: a typo in an imported bone map was indistinguishable
 *    from a deliberately partial one. It now returns the skipped bones so the
 *    host can compare against what it meant to map.
 *
 * Scenarios: an unresolvable scene node throws naming the node and the model; a
 * two-bone skeleton applied to a model mapping only `hips` reports `head` as
 * skipped (and nothing when the map is complete).
