/**
 * The player's secondary-motion springs run between sampling and rendering, and
 * `dampedSpring` OVERSHOOTS by design (ζ < 1). Clamping only before the springs
 * let the render exceed the ROM the `clampToRom` constructor promise
 * guarantees: stiffness 100 / damping 5 stepping toward a 40° cap peaked at ≈
 * 58° (#1048). A joint vanishing from the sampled pose also hard-reset its
 * spring, popping follow-through to rest mid-swing.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A spring stepping toward a 40°-capped flexion never RENDERS past 40°, while
 *    still reaching the cap (the clamp engages; the spring is not simply
 *    critically damped).
 * 2. When the sampled pose stops authoring the joint entirely, its follow-through
 *    DECAYS smoothly toward neutral instead of vanishing: the joint is still
 *    driven on the first absent frame and settles near zero later.
