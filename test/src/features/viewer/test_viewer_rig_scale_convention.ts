/**
 * The rig scale convention (#1052, decision 309): the engine's FK composes
 * rotation and translation ONLY: `resolvePose` ignores bone-rest and pose-root
 * scale, and `motionToClip` pins the same ("rest scale ignored on both sides"),
 * so the render must ignore them too. The viewer used to apply both, making
 * every descendant diverge from what ground contact, collision, and framing
 * validated. Scene-node transforms and object-motion scale channels stay
 * first-class (#1049); this convention is about RIG bones and pose roots only.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. A pose root with scale 2 moves the model root but leaves its scale at 1.
 * 2. A bone rest with scale 2 places the bone but leaves its scale at 1.
