# Human face study observations

Current working documents now include numerical surface hair for all nineteen subjects and explicit resting-skin profiles for Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon and Miriam Margolyes. The source basis and reference records are retained. The first subject's time-capped facial parameters are unchanged. The artifact hashes and dated face-only observations below are historical, not identities or acceptance records for these new working documents. Current replay, hair and skin render verification must be recorded separately before this revision is shipped. All nineteen likenesses remain unaccepted.

All nineteen subject documents are numerical studies, not accepted photographic likenesses. The first subject's fitting effort stopped after approximately 57 minutes within the user's one-hour upper bound. The remaining eighteen were each adjusted through the actual face editor and saved as JSON, GLB and glTF. The files in this directory retain their numerical construction and performance inputs. No original photograph, detector or fitting runtime is required to construct these documents.

The per-person `Replay document bytes` below identify the original saved artifacts used for the recorded captures, not the current repository file bytes. Repository formatting added one final LF to all nineteen JSON files; the first subject also retains empty `controls`, `detail` and left/right `asymmetry` objects that do not alter its resolved recipe. On 2026-09-13, all nineteen current documents were built and exported twice under Node 22.23.2. Each pair reproduced the same model JSON and GLB bytes, and all model JSON digests matched the historical artifacts below. Independently decoded historical/current GLBs had exact positions, indices, UVs, materials and metadata; sixteen GLBs were byte-identical, while Alan, Michael and Park each differed in one same-sign Float32 normal component by one ULP. The first subject's frozen model and GLB remained byte-identical. This replay observation does not accept likeness or replace the capture-specific records.

[Input inventory](inputs.md) records all 85 retained originals, their pinned source URLs, hashes, dimensions, selections and quality limitations. The subjects are examples in `test`, not built-in people in the human package. They do not constitute a generated film: production storytelling, shots, delivery and release layers are not applicable to this static face-editor study. Generated-project API reachability and instruction synchronization are verified separately.

The recorded rendering path reads each actual exported GLB with Blender 5.2 Cycles on CPU. The editor uses Three.js on AMD Radeon 8060S through ANGLE/D3D11. These renderers have different lighting responses. Calibration, front, anatomical left/right obliques, left/right profiles, back, reference pose and clay were all opened directly by the main agent on 2026-09-12. A completed image inventory is not a source-code Self-Review, a collision certificate or a likeness acceptance.

For the eighteen editor saves, two independent Node 22.15.0 builds produced identical model JSON and GLB bytes within that runtime; reloading the browser's downloaded glTF/resources reproduces its saved GLB. Browser-versus-Node positions, indices, materials and glTF metadata are exact. Park, Alan and Michael each differ in one Float32 normal value by one ULP; the other fifteen saved GLBs are byte-identical across these runtimes. Different V8 numerical evaluation is a hypothesis, not a traced cause. Captures use the browser artifact, never a substituted Node reconstruction. The first subject's human observed-pose capture uses its separately identified Node-built artifact.

Construction, document replay and glTF admission passed for the artifacts named below; capture completeness and direct image review are recorded per artifact. Likeness remains unaccepted for every subject. Source review, canonical suite, packed consumer checks and CI are still pending at this record's initial publication and must not be inferred from these image observations.

## Oral joint-space experiment, 2026-09-16 {#oral-joint-space-2026-09-16}

The continuing #2498 investigation retains the tooth-fit candidates against their original source basis and examines the connected interior as one shared problem. This checkpoint uses source `f04544a4`, the same selected photographs, calibrated AMD Radeon 8060S rendering, observed/oral-gaze states, and unchanged exterior parts and materials. It preserves every failed cavity, unfinished solver and unfavorable measurement. These cavity meshes are cached-model experiments; the accompanying parent face documents do not reproduce their replacement interior through `buildHumanFace` yet.

The actual source-built joint tooth placement removes upper-enamel versus head/lip intersections in all four people across observed, neutral and oral-gaze states. In the preceding unconstrained fit, Alan had 28/32/58 and Oh 105/106/73 intersecting triangle pairs respectively; both now have 0/0/0. The upper arch stays exact across states, and non-dental parts remain unchanged. Alan's additional posterior movement is 1.28357515534418 mm and Oh's is 1.449994597102961 mm, with coupled lift preserving the recorded photograph's vertical projection. Horizontal projection changes by -0.5708 mm and +0.2065 mm respectively. Pair counts are intersection witnesses, not penetrated area or anatomical severity.

The first independent upper-vault/lower-floor enclosure removed many enamel intersections but protruded through the commissures. Full projected triangle constraints against enamel and exterior skin removed those protrusions for Yoo and Maggie. A subsequent exact-rational audit identified seven Yoo lip crossings introduced by Float32 XY rounding. Rebuilding the complete constraint domain on actual Float32 XY and obstacle coordinates removed all seven. This separates source shape, exported representation and render observations rather than compensating with a manually increased tolerance.

The next comparison retains the conservative numerical error constant but assigns uncertainty only to newly rounded free Z coordinates. Fixed exported rim coordinates incur no new error. An explicit coordinate envelope bounds the ULP calculation in both the solve and export. The coarse space becomes feasible for Yoo, Maggie and Oh, while Alan retains a 0.003196586-mm minimum uniform constraint slack. One centroid per vestibular triangle supplies local depth freedom without changing original vertices or edges. Under the same ownership rule, all four enriched problems are feasible with all-row residuals around 1e-13 mm. This is geometry feasibility, not a biomechanical tissue model or a measured palate.

Six coarse and eight enriched GLBs passed actual export. All fourteen have zero cavity/enamel and cavity/head intersections; exact-rational classification confines all cavity/lip contacts to the copied shared seam. Their topology is an opposed manifold disk with Euler characteristic one, and both source-double and Float32 rim coordinates are exact. The main agent directly inspected all 126 new GPU views, including both obliques, both profiles, back, clay and registered reference views. The black commissural wings remain removed. The open interior still looks empty and simplified, with a flat-looking floor and no lower enamel or tongue in this cohort. Existing lid, nasal, age, hair and cervical defects remain.

The same manually read photograph columns give the following incisal-edge mean absolute errors. Measurements use 0.25-pixel sampling of final Float32 geometric visibility, with no alpha-indeterminate rays. They do not measure shaded brightness, unseen anatomy, held-out fitting accuracy or whole-face likeness. Alan's enriched interior exposes the incisal contour that the legacy backdrop obscured; the earlier joint-placement/legacy-interior combination measured 3.50 px and the unrestricted fit measured 2.8125 px.

| Person | Original error (px) | Enriched candidate error (px) | Manual source-reading uncertainty (px) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Yoo Seung-ho | 0.95 | 0.70 | 1.2 |
| Alan Rickman | 8.125 | 1.65 | 2.0 |
| Maggie Smith | 3.10 | 0.4833 | 1.0 |
| Oh Seung-yoon | 1.8667 | 0.4167 | 1.0 |

Independent self-contact checks expose an unresolved defect despite those improvements. Coarse observed outputs have no self-crossings, but open Yoo/Maggie/Oh have 160/225/160 crossing pairs. Enriched observed Yoo/Alan/Maggie/Oh have 0/36/2/11 and open outputs have 265/184/415/328. Every final witness is already a crossing in source doubles. Some Maggie/Oh open-state pairs also cross in the original unoptimized vault. Same-column ring order is therefore insufficient, and the initial vestibule itself has an embedding defect. Five Maggie open-state pairs within the same vestibular band have exact affine depth gaps of both signs, approximately -0.00268 to +0.23678 mm. Preserving their original order is not a valid repair premise. The investigation is tracing attachment correspondence and the full surface representation before another solve.

Primary anatomical references distinguish fixed palate/maxillary supports from mandibular and lingual supports. [ArtiSynth skinning](https://www.artisynth.org/manuals/topic/org.artisynth.doc/html/modelguide/Ch11.html?cp=1_11) connects an airway boundary to those masters, but its [limitations](https://www.artisynth.org/manuals/topic/org.artisynth.doc/html/modelguide/Ch11.S5.html) explicitly include folding and self-intersection; attachment weights alone are not a nonintersection guarantee. [Hewer et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07679) constrain an MRI-derived palate shape space using anatomical landmarks. These sources guide ownership and shape constraints, not hidden dimensions recovered from the study photographs. [ECMAScript Math.fround](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2025/multipage/numbers-and-dates.html#sec-math.fround) and the [glTF accessor specification](https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#accessor-data-types) establish the numerical transport basis.

All artifacts remain under `.shots/human-2469/investigation-2498/`: `oral-joint-placement`, `oral-owned-{coarse,enriched}-constrained-l1`, their `*-contacts` and `*-self-contact` directories, `oral-owned-self-contact-stages.json`, `oral-self-order/exact-ambiguities.json`, and `oral-owned-direct-review.json`. The last receipt binds every directly read image hash and the independent measurements. The partial clearance and visibility improvements remain preserved for product integration. Self-embedding, anatomical contents, replayable expression behavior and whole-face likeness are still active work; this checkpoint is not the final whole-PR Self-Review or acceptance.

The subsequent comparison at source `1a432347` keeps those failures and changes the complete ring correspondence. A shared visibility-kernel origin gives each retained cross-section a cyclic angular chart. It changes triangle connectivity and the vestibular centroid basis while keeping original boundary/ring points and all non-cavity parts. All self-order constraints include both moving triangles, combine shared-coordinate coefficients before bounding Float32 error, and cover line/point as well as full-area projected domains. Adjacent faces are exempt only when their complete projected intersection domain lies on their actual shared feature. This is a deterministic geometric feasibility experiment, not an anatomical palate reconstruction.

All four complete problems are feasible. Their maximum original-row residuals are between 7.25e-13 and 1.43e-11 mm. Eight actual GLBs preserve the source/Float32 lip seam, shared upper support, materials and opposed manifold-disk topology. Independent exact integer-plane and rational-intersection checks examine every overlapping final Float32 triangle AABB pair, including pairs rejected by the earlier floating SAT. For every subject and both states, cavity self-crossings, cavity/enamel crossings and cavity/head crossings are zero; all cavity/lip intersections lie on the copied seam. The preceding enriched open-state counts 265/184/415/328 become 0/0/0/0. The same four incisal-column errors remain 0.70/1.65/0.4833/0.4167 px.

The main agent directly read all 72 new GPU views. The large commissural protrusions remain removed, but Oh's open-state front and profile show small dark marks beside the commissure. Six fixed-GLB controls preserve them with shadows disabled and with a 9.48-times finer orthographic depth-storage interval; hiding the cavity removes them. An actual GLB ray at one affected pixel meets the outer skin about 0.000051 mm before the inner surface. Exact nonintersection therefore does not establish adequate tissue separation or stable rendering. Two additional CPU clip-coordinate controls are captured but have not been directly read at this checkpoint. No part-specific depth bias, hidden cavity or custom shader is adopted as a repair.

The new artifacts are `oral-complete-{polytope,linear,constrained-l1}`, `oral-complete-all-aabb`, `oral-complete-self-contact`, `oral-complete-constrained-contacts`, `oral-complete-visibility`, `oral-complete-constrained-captures.json`, `oral-render-probe-v2` and `oral-render-ray-hits.json` under the same retained investigation directory. Their identities and numerical witnesses remain available alongside the earlier failed spaces. These cached replacement interiors still need a practical, anatomical document-to-editor consumer; the experiment is not a mandatory editor solver or a new likeness acceptance.

The user subsequently clarified the face-editor priority: recognizable eyes, nose, mouth and whole facial form come first. Exact placement of individual wrinkles or pigment spots is not a fitting target. Existing detail grounded in mathematics, physics or anatomy remains eligible for integration when its effect is verified; no research is discarded. Monochrome, blurred and low-resolution references remain required inputs. Infer missing structure from the visible proportions and relevant anatomical references, distinguish authored estimates from observations, and judge the assembled face across views rather than treating low resolution as an exemption.

The 2026-09-17 checkpoint at `d94b5b6a` separates numerical delivery from new anatomy. The pinned Clarabel engine constructs and exports all nineteen documents in observed, neutral and oral-gaze states, improving the previous 49/57 success count to 57/57. Existing successful states retain topology; their maximum vertex movement is 0.000097924 mm. The retained complete oral problems also replay through that engine: all eight replacement interiors have exactly the previous Float32 positions and triangle indices. This adds numerical reach, not new likeness. Their canonical documents still do not construct those cached interiors.

An observed-only minimum-displacement roof followed by exact freezing is not an adequate identity construction. All four observed fits solve, but their frozen coordinates alone violate open-state affine constraints by 0.883 to 3.065 mm. These are depth-inequality violations, not penetration volumes. The actual dental attachment frame places 162 to 240 of the 461 alleged roof variables below the crowns' common cervical plane: that group mixes lateral enclosure with upper tissue. This counterexample rejects that particular freeze procedure, not the previous joint candidates or every possible fixed palate.

The [VocalTractLab source](https://github.com/TUD-STKS/VocalTractLabBackend-dev/tree/df30392f18dc5e175b577c3ba734caaa65a3927f) and [Birkholz et al.](https://www.vocaltractlab.de/publications/birkholz-2006-icassp.pdf) provide a useful attachment comparison. The unmodified native backend was built and called on 125 default-anatomy combinations: five values, including endpoints, for jaw angle, lip protrusion and lip distance. Its reference palate and upper teeth remain exactly fixed; moving lip attachments stay on the actual gingival polylines within 9.16e-15 mm, and lower-tooth pair distances change by at most 4.44e-14 mm. This finite experiment does not certify collision freedom, arbitrary anatomy or MetaHuman superiority. The reference palate is distinct from the final upper cover's posterior velum blend. The GPL implementation remains local research, not a copied product dependency.

The next local construction uses the product dental row's actual cervical cap boundaries after inter-crown separation. All four people have ten closed, 32-vertex neck loops; every extracted edge belongs to one cap and one crown-side triangle. A separate cuboid oracle checks boundary extraction. A representative Yoo maxillary surface preserves all 320 neck vertices exactly, with an independently authored outer contour and a midsagittal reference profile sampled from VTL's default anatomy. The 2-mm outer offset and 8/12/16-mm height trials are explicit experimental estimates, not that person's measured hidden anatomy. They remain outside the canonical recipe.

Merely inserting interior samples into the initial ear-clipped mesh produces long, narrow triangles and a biased graph interpolant. A [constrained Delaunay comparison](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/tripaper/triangle2.html), using exact dyadic-integer orientation and incircle signs, changes connectivity while retaining all planar points, attachment edges and authored height constraints. For the same 1,016 points and 1,608 triangles, the median minimum triangle angle improves from 0.541 to 45 degrees; triangles below five degrees fall from 1,356 to 10, and the longest planar edge falls from 59.777 to 2.828 mm. These are discretization measures, not anatomical accuracy or likeness. The new interpolation still has local peaks at isolated height pins and a deliberately simplified outer contour.

The 12-mm representative is checked in both observed and oral-gaze states against every overlapping final Float32 AABB pair. Exact integer-plane and rational-intersection classification finds zero self-crossings and zero crossings with enamel, head, lips or the prior enclosure. All 3,620 tissue/enamel contacts are confined to the actual shared cervical features. The earlier triangulation also had no forbidden intersections; the Delaunay change improves discretization rather than repairing a previously measured penetration. The 8/16-mm variants have source attachment, export and floating-contact checks but have not received the same exact census.

Twenty whole-face A/B captures and twelve correctly centered isolated captures were directly read on AMD Radeon 8060S. The isolated underside needed a separately labelled lower directional light rig to reveal its form; twelve further diagnostic captures were inspected, including the 12-mm underside and clay originals. Earlier clipped isolated views are preserved as a camera-instrument failure. Eight of ten whole-face A/B pairs are pixel-identical; the two views from below differ at 100 and 224 of 810,000 pixels. The original enclosure is deliberately retained in this structural experiment, and ordinary facial appearance is unchanged. This is no new whole-face likeness improvement and no completed oral replacement. The next integration must connect mobile vestibular tissue between the actual lip rim and fixed outer gingiva, then supply mandibular floor/side-wall attachments and recheck their shared contacts. Vestibular tissue in front of enamel and the oral cavity behind it cannot share a universal posterior-depth condition.

The retained artifacts are `dental-cervical-boundaries.*`, `vtl-probe-v2`, `oral-identity-fit`, `maxillary-attachment-study` and `maxillary-attachment-study-cdt` under `.shots/human-2469/investigation-2498/`. The latter includes source hashes, exact-contact witnesses, original GLBs, camera/light receipts, connectivity metrics and pixel comparisons. These observations preserve all prior candidates and remain research evidence; general expression/editor integration, whole-face improvement and the final whole-PR Self-Review are still unfinished.

The subsequent interpolation comparison at `18bd3348` retains the same planar points, CDT triangles, actual tooth holes and all 449 prescribed heights. [Stein et al.](https://arxiv.org/html/1707.04348v1), sections 4.4.1 and 5.2, distinguish the boundary conditions of the full squared Laplacian from its interior-row form. The latter is used with the already prescribed boundary heights and barycentric lumped masses. An independent 3-4-5 triangle checks stiffness and mass; an affine field with known interior height 3.6 reconstructs as 3.599999999999027, whereas the explicitly different full-row control gives 3.6513570649122324. Residual variables express the energy through the existing diagonal QP without another product solver. This scalar interpolation experiment is neither the complete bounded-biharmonic skinning system nor a constitutive tissue model.

For the 12-mm representative, area-weighted neighboring-gradient RMS is 0.348383 for the previous positive graph, 0.265295 for the separate first-order FEM control, and 0.093694 for bounded second-order FEM. The corresponding 95th-percentile normal-angle differences are 17.416, 12.714 and 8.978 degrees. Actual section and oblique diagrams show broader continuity around the former isolated height peaks. All fixed heights remain exact. Nineteen free local maxima remain in each second-order candidate, at heights no greater than 0.000002770 mm across the three trials; they are retained rather than clamped or called absent. The estimated profile and simplified outer contour remain anatomical limitations, and these finite triangle metrics do not establish continuous C1 geometry or likeness.

All six second-order exports, three heights in observed and oral-gaze states, pass the final Float32 all-AABB exact-contact census: self-crossings and crossings with enamel, head, lips and the previous cavity are zero; each output's 3,620 tissue/enamel contacts remain confined to actual shared cervical features. Twenty whole-face A/B views and twelve isolated views were directly read on AMD Radeon 8060S, together with the 12-mm underside and clay originals. Nine of ten whole-face pairs are pixel-identical; the remaining open-state view from below differs at two of 810,000 pixels. The improved fixed-tissue candidate is preserved for the ongoing joint attachment construction. The existing enclosure, missing mobile vestibule/floor/side-wall integration and unchanged whole-face appearance prevent interpreting it as completed product integration. `maxillary-attachment-study-fem` retains every model, contact witness, camera receipt, FEM control and plot alongside the earlier candidates.

At `35c6d8b2`, the actual mouth component, subdivision and region compactor identify the final upper and lower lip arcs by native vertex identity. Their whole compact index buffers match both exported parent states before transferring the original socket landmarks. The subsequent GLB read checks complete material-group buffers and preserves the actual Float32 attachment values. The first probe's legacy-cavity assumption and the first reader's part-per-node assumption both fail and remain recorded; neither is interpreted as a product regression.

The first connecting ribbon maps the complete 95-point gingival U to the 41-point anterior upper lip by observed arc length, preserving both boundaries and one topology across states. Independent flat rectangles verify its strip topology and area. Although it exports and has no self, palate, lip, head or old-cavity crossings, it crosses enamel in 737 observed and 730 open-state triangle pairs. Both states implicate the same 55 of its 134 triangles, visibly spanning the lateral dental arch. The subsequent structural comparison follows the native reference's distinction between a posterior cheek path and the anterior aperture: correspondence breaks at each observed commissure's anterior plane, and a separately estimated buccal path follows the existing gingival contour before reaching that corner. Its inferred inferior offsets, 6.642049 and 6.658377 mm here, are not measured anatomy. The 190-vertex, 188-triangle candidate retains observed correspondence across both states. All six exact final-Float32 contact populations have zero forbidden crossings in each state, and all 94 gingival plus 40 lip attachment edges oppose their actual neighboring edges. This finite upper-tissue comparison neither supplies full mandibular ownership nor certifies arbitrary expressions.

All 70 subsequent GPU captures were directly read: three whole models in nine views and two states, plus sixteen isolated comparisons. The initial capture's ignored reference-view flag is preserved as an instrument error; the subsequent run invokes the real registration function and checks matching returned whole-face cameras. The new buccal path removes the lateral dental chords in the isolated geometry, while whole-face changes remain small: one and three changed front pixels, zero and two registered-view pixels, and at most 133 of 810,000 pixels across other views. The original enclosure and existing facial limitations remain. `upper-attachment-ribbon`, `cheek-attachment-ribbon` and `attachment-ribbon-comparison` preserve both structural candidates, exact witnesses, GLBs, camera receipts and failed instruments. The improved upper attachment is retained for document-driven expression and full-enclosure integration; canonical study documents still do not construct it.

The next actual-source performance matrix builds seven open states: jaw rotation at 12.5/25 degrees, lip separation at 15/30 mm, pucker at 4 mm, bilateral smile at 8 mm and asymmetric smile at 8/-5 mm, retaining the other observed controls. These are supported product values, not measured physiological limits. All seven build and export. Six have zero forbidden intersections in the six upper-ribbon contact populations and the two additional parent tooth-versus-lip/skin populations. Maximum pucker instead has 371 ribbon/enamel, 151 parent enamel/lip and 91 parent enamel/skin crossing pairs. The other five ribbon populations remain clear. The closed case has only its existing parent output; it does not validate a new closed interior. All 75 GPU images were directly read. Teeth visibly emerge near the puckered commissures in both parent and candidate. Some close views crop the lower jaw at 25 degrees, so the matching cameras do not constitute complete visual coverage. The earlier successful upper attachment remains preserved, and this extension prevents claiming expression-wide acceptance.

A read-only V8 debugger observes nine stages of the unmodified source builder in observed and maximum-pucker states. Both resulting whole models match the preceding unobserved builds exactly, and the final captured triangle positions match the actual compact output regions. Independent final-Float32 classification finds no lip/enamel crossing before oral performance, then 165 pairs immediately after pucker targets are applied. Blending and cage attachment retain those 165 pairs, while adjacent cage skin has 111 pairs. Subdivision has 149 lip and 99 skin pairs; surface layers produce the final 151 and 91, which replacements, final shaping and seam sealing retain. The observed state remains clear at every corresponding stage. Pair counts across different tessellations are not anatomical severity comparisons. This traces the initial defect to the unconstrained performed tissue, before export or rendering. The initial debugger worker's early exit and the corrected observer are both retained as instrument history.

[Groleau et al.](https://www.isca-archive.org/maveba_2007/groleau07_maveba.pdf) compare lip motion with and without lip/teeth and lip/lip contacts; their results also show that contact alone does not establish correct protrusion. [Stavness et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.2548) model rigid maxillary/mandibular supports, mobile lip and cheek regions, and separate contact interactions. These studies motivate a coupled support relationship, not a universal narrowing coefficient or measured hidden anatomy for this portrait. The next repair must preserve the fixed dental identity, shared lip/skin attachments and earlier successful expressions while addressing tissue contact before rebuilding the interior. `upper-attachment-performance` and `pucker-source-stage-trace` retain all input documents, actual outputs, exact witnesses, debugger locations and capture receipts. Product integration and the final whole-PR Self-Review remain unfinished.

The next source-`d2609402` comparison applies the existing shared contact and skin owners to the actual 1,040 lip vertices and their authored 14-mm geodesic neighborhood. Keeping transverse coordinates and fixed enamel, the source zero-gap solution still has 224 lip/enamel and 25 skin/enamel crossing pairs after Float32 conversion. Solving on actual Float32 transverse coordinates with the retained coordinate-envelope rounding bound removes both populations completely. Its maximum tissue displacement is 2.593456294 mm. The 0.0002064765-mm clearance is a numerical transport guard, not tissue thickness. Independent exact whole-skin censuses finish for the original, zero-gap and Float32 candidates: all have zero self-crossings beyond their actual shared topology. The directly read eighteen-view comparisons show reduced commissural tooth emergence, without new likeness acceptance.

Reattaching the earlier upper strip to that corrected exterior leaves 332 enamel, 81 lip and 14 skin crossing pairs. Seven enamel-crossing triangles have all three vertices prescribed by gingiva or the shared lip; eight lip-crossing and five skin-crossing triangles likewise have no independent vertex. The strip has no interior vertices, so moving its posterior cheek variables cannot change those triangles. An independently derived Hermite comparison adds transverse shape freedom while preserving native boundary positions and opposing attachment directions, but still has eight self, 313 enamel, 126 lip and 56 skin crossing pairs. Tessellation differs, so these counts are not severity ratios. All eighteen whole-face views of each structure were read directly; their small external difference does not establish a valid hidden connection.

[IDP](https://ipc-sim.github.io/IDP/file/paper_small.pdf), sections 4.2 through 4.4, separates contact barriers, boundary conditions and shape energies. A local research comparison uses [IPC Toolkit 1.6.0](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/tree/478876f30bf8ea768772dd8983c26a1a801ad976) as contact primitives, not a complete physiological solver. Independent triangles verify an analytical time of impact of 0.5 against the conservative native step 0.4999499321, detect crossing between individually clear endpoints, and check barrier gradients within 4.23e-13. The pinned Windows wheel and source remain research dependencies outside product packages.

The actual combined complex has 32,243 vertices, 64,410 triangles and initially 6,186 free vertices. Lip/skin variables are shared, maxillary enamel and palate are fixed, and splitting only internal strip edges adds 187 free interior vertices without changing boundary edges. The initial observed complex passes the native intersection check. A reference-normal hemisphere restriction stalls and is retained as an inappropriate rotation constraint. Its replacement uses rotationally invariant symmetric-Dirichlet distortion, a nonzero-area step bound and continuous collision filtering. Independent finite differences check distortion gradient and Hessian errors below 1.67e-9 and 6.94e-10 respectively. These are geometric energies, not a measured muscle or material law.

The sixty-iteration candidate exports through the actual product writer as GLB `b1691695eff57cfdb66dbd83991e1b56a178b5251b975c716d6959d0c22d568b`. All eight final-Float32 exact contact populations pass: upper-strip self, palate, enamel, lips, head and prior cavity, plus enamel against lips and head. All 134 native attachment edges retain opposite winding. Whole-skin native double and Float32 checks also report no intersection, but this new shared skin has not received the earlier candidates' independent exact self census. All fixed vertices remain exact. The maximum target deviation is 3.516008176 mm, and sixty iterations do not satisfy the declared convergence criterion. Continuing the same objective to 240 iterations reduces the final search direction to 0.000457719 mm, still above that criterion; it remains a separately retained unconverged run.

All 26 corresponding whole-face and isolated-anatomy GPU views of the sixty-iteration candidate were directly read. Each pair uses an explicit common camera; the earlier isolated-Hermite run's differing bounds-derived cameras remain a failed instrument record. The joint candidate clears the inspected upper contact geometry, but visibly separates lower-lid margins and wrinkles the lip corners. Its right/left eyelids deviate from the requested shape by up to 0.831268/0.418803 mm, although observed-to-target changes there were only 0.000347/0.000627 mm. Selecting every numerically changed vertex therefore grants unrelated fitted components new degrees of freedom. Contact success is preserved without accepting this whole-face regression. The next domain comparison fixes performed coordinates outside the authored mouth reach exactly. A separate bending comparison follows the reference-curvature distinction in [Discrete Shells](https://www.multires.caltech.edu/pubs/Shells.pdf), section 2; its geometric stiffness is not an inferred human tissue modulus. These comparisons still require completed solves, export, exact contact checks and direct inspection.

The retained locations are `pucker-shared-contact*`, `pucker-upper-{composite,tangent}`, `ipc-oral-joint`, `ipc-oral-distortion`, `ipc-oral-distortion-resumed`, `pucker-ipc-sixty` and `ipc-domain-plan.md` under the investigation directory. The successful contacts, failed representations, derivations, solver logs, original images and independent witnesses are all preserved. Canonical editor replay, mandibular and posterior enclosure, complete expression coverage and whole-face likeness remain unfinished.

The subsequent domain comparison fixes the requested performed coordinates outside the authored 14-mm mouth geodesic reach, leaving 1,801 free vertices. The same native initial nonintersection and prescribed attachment checks pass. Its 180-step output clears the eight exact upper-contact populations and retains the eyelid and nostril target coordinates exactly after Float32 conversion. However, sharp commissural folds remain; continuing the same membrane-only problem to 360 iterations still does not satisfy the convergence criterion. This preserves the successful locality correction and the unresolved shape behavior separately.

The shell comparison adds the reference-dihedral energy in Discrete Shells, section 2, equation 2, using rest-edge length weights. Its coefficient of 14 cubed is a geometric editing scale, not measured tissue stiffness. An independent right-angle hinge has the expected energy pi squared over two; rigid-transform invariance and finite differences verify the gradient within 1.29e-11. The exact objective gradient uses a positive-semidefinite Gauss-Newton search matrix and actual-energy line search. The first construction refuses a rigid three-face cervical junction. That failed run is preserved; the subsequent construction removes fixed-only constant stencils before requiring every variable hinge to be manifold.

The combined shell/contact solution converges after 110 accepted steps, with maximum Newton direction 9.839293764e-7 mm against the unchanged 1e-6-mm criterion. Prescribed vertices do not move; maximum target deviation is 3.693354515 mm. Its actual GLB is `cc7da7bbaea1a9c9411332a397e0f4ed3ad81cc2db02540a92a8ee8a29e44a2f`. An independent reader checks every POSITION and index in all four exported material groups against native placement and merging. Maximum Float32 transport movement is 0.000004141 mm. All eight exact upper-contact populations have zero forbidden intersections, and all 134 attachment edges retain opposing neighbors. The independent full shared-skin census also has zero self-crossings beyond actual shared topology across 54,752 triangles and 367,820 overlapping AABB pairs.

All 26 domain-only and all 26 shell-comparison GPU views were directly inspected with common cameras and lighting. The shell candidate retains the target eyelids and nostrils exactly and visibly softens the sharp lip-corner folds. Across the same 2,800 lip hinges, edge-length-weighted RMS deviation from target dihedral angles falls from 13.705414 to 0.696685 degrees; the 95th percentile falls from 37.752484 to 1.796753 degrees. These are discrete shape measures, not anatomical truth or likeness. The membrane comparison is unconverged, and adding shell energy also changes adaptive initial barrier stiffness, so this is a structural comparison rather than a converged single-coefficient A/B. Existing simplified dentition, interior and whole-face limitations remain visible.

An inclusive BVH and an exact integer plane-sign implication accelerate the independent skin audit without changing its contact population or tolerance. Three hundred box queries match dense candidate sets; 671 shared-point implications match the independent rational classifier, which still catches the negative example crossing beyond a shared vertex. Replaying an earlier completed dense audit reproduces all 367,915 candidate pairs, 40,478 disjoint pairs, 327,437 allowed contacts and zero crossings. That same audit takes 52.67 seconds instead of 1,931.25 seconds; the new shell candidate takes 52.37 seconds. This is verification speed, separate from editor or solver speed.

The successful research solve takes 360.75 seconds, so interactive product integration remains unresolved. Profiling identifies native collision construction and contact Hessian assembly as substantial costs. At the actual initial and converged states, removing only fixed-only contact stencils preserves the free gradient and Hessian blocks exactly. Converged Hessian time falls from 1.212 to 0.043 seconds, but the first Python partition itself costs 33.26 seconds. Supplying the native binding's column-major int32 topology instead of repeatedly converting complete arrays reduces partition time to 0.83 seconds. A separate native primitive filter preserves the free Hessian and gradient exactly at all thirteen retained initial, intermediate and converged states. The subsequent complete solve uses that filter only for Hessian assembly, retaining the original full energy, gradient, CCD and adaptive minimum-distance calculations. It converges in the same 110 accepted steps. Every non-time iteration field, all eleven saved intermediate coordinate arrays and the final coordinate array are byte-identical to the original run. Elapsed time is 205.57 seconds versus the earlier 360.75 seconds. These sequential wall times are not repeated controlled benchmarks, and the remaining cost is still unsuitable for direct per-slider interaction.

These later artifacts are `ipc-oral-domain*`, `pucker-ipc-{domain,bending}`, `ipc-shape-comparison.json`, `exact-contact-bvh.py`, `audit-shared-self-bvh.py`, `ipc-fixed-term-profile.json`, `ipc-array-layout-profile.json` and `ipc-native-variable-profile.json`. The successful shape and contacts are preserved for real document/editor integration. The lower floor, posterior enclosure, expression and subject extension, coefficient sensitivity and practical runtime remain open. Canonical inputs still do not replay the cached research meshes, and this checkpoint is not whole-face acceptance or the final whole-PR Self-Review.

The next comparison consumes the original performed target directly, instead of the target already corrected by the exterior-only QP. It preserves the feasible initial geometry, all faces, fixed targets and free ownership. The 662 changed target vertices differ by at most 2.593457699 mm; target-based strain, curvature and adaptive stiffness change together, so this is a structural comparison. The raw-target solve converges after 122 accepted steps with maximum direction 9.680006333e-7 mm. Fixed coordinates remain exact. Its actual GLB `95048f068e40f8ea27cdb49a8014ed6b96380b94930aa3087b94f24f3ab55c98` passes all four complete material-buffer comparisons, all eight exact contact populations and the whole-skin census of 54,752 triangles and 368,083 overlapping AABB pairs. All 134 shared attachment edges retain opposing winding.

All 26 raw-target comparison views were directly read with the same explicit cameras and calibrated AMD GPU. No renewed lower-lid separation or sharp commissural folding is visible. Comparing both candidates against this same original target, the 2,800 lip hinges' weighted RMS angular deviation falls from 6.435859 to 0.423754 degrees and the 95th percentile from 15.454566 to 1.080864 degrees. The earlier 0.696685-degree result used a different, corrected target and is not the denominator for this comparison. The eyelids and nostril target coordinates remain exact after Float32 transport. This establishes the representative raw-input joint construction, not all expressions, complete anatomy or new likeness.

A browser-port experiment builds the unmodified pinned IPC source with the official [oneTBB serial WebAssembly mode](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB/blob/v2022.3.0/WASM_Support.md). Independent contact, distortion and hinge probes return the same 22 numerical values in Node and Chromium, including repeated calls. The ordinary browser page has no cross-origin-isolation headers or SharedArrayBuffer. The first JavaScript harness incorrectly treated the ES-module factory as synchronous; its failed log is retained, and awaiting the actual factory fixes that boundary. The first real-face initialization exposes an Eigen sparse-triplet temporary of 128,972 bytes exceeding Emscripten's default 64-KiB stack. Function-name and stack-overflow instrumentation locate that failure. An explicit [one-MiB runtime stack](https://emscripten.org/docs/tools_reference/settings_reference.html#stack-size) preserves the library and numerical formulas while retaining overflow checks.

The full port uses the same objective, original collision mesh, fixed ownership, adaptive stiffness, full energy/gradient/CCD and Hessian-only removal of constant contacts. Eigen sparse LDLT replaces SciPy SuperLU. Initial objective and full-gradient maximum differences are 5.24e-10 and 9.01e-11 respectively. Nine identical-coordinate comparisons, spanning both trajectories' initial, intermediate and final states, pass the predeclared absolute 1e-7 plus relative 1e-10 tolerances. These probes test the numerical port; they do not supply a physiological material model.

Both Python and Node/WASM converge after 122 accepted steps, but their final vertices differ by up to 0.030054089 mm, failing the declared 0.0001-mm position-equivalence comparison. That failed result is preserved. Read-only observations reproduce the first five non-time records of each original run exactly. Each runtime returns identical CCD bounds when given the other runtime's exact path endpoints. Before the first changed bound, endpoint differences reach 6.34e-9 mm; the later nonlinear trajectories separate. The evidence supports sensitivity to the path's floating-point differences, not a demonstrated disagreement between the two CCD implementations. The final WASM candidate has slightly lower energy under the unchanged Python evaluator; neither a lower objective nor a small displacement establishes likeness.

Re-querying three admitted early paths with IPC's default predicate initially reports false. The native source adds an effective positive-distance envelope inside its CCD strategy. An independent pair of tilted parallel triangles stays at least 0.00004472136 units apart while reproducing default refusal and literal-zero-envelope acceptance; an actual crossing remains refused. A horizontal version was culled by the broad phase and is retained as an inadequate instrument. All five recorded facial paths pass the explicitly zero-envelope continuous queries, including a 1e-9 root tolerance and unlimited root iterations. These diagnostic queries leave the solver's original conservative gate unchanged and distinguish its envelope refusal from a proved zero-distance crossing. They are not a census of every accepted path.

A genuine Chromium worker independently completes the same full WASM solve. All 122 non-time step records and every final coordinate are exact against Node/WASM. Its main-page timer continues throughout. Sequential elapsed times are Python 243.13 seconds, Node/WASM 152.94 seconds and browser worker 133.30 seconds; these are single runs, not a controlled repeated benchmark or an interactive-editor performance claim. The actual WASM-candidate GLB is `df7b0ce363c7769d8fd143b06ec824029f3f16e4a042fd587ead95cfe5aff644`. All four exported material groups match native buffers, all eight exact contact populations are clear, all 134 attachment edges remain opposed, and the complete skin census has zero forbidden self-crossings across 368,082 AABB pairs.

All 26 new Python/WASM comparison views were directly inspected. Front, obliques, profiles, below, clay and wider framing retain the visible facial form without a new gross protrusion or separation. Whole-face pairs differ at zero to 265 of 810,000 pixels; this registered image difference is not a quality score. Target eyelids and nostrils remain exact. Lip curvature RMS is 0.423754 versus 0.423022 degrees, while its 95th percentile is 1.080864 versus 1.084474 degrees; the mixed change is not uniformly better. Bulky orbital tissue, angular nasal base, uniform crowns, simplified interior and narrow cervical form remain. The port is retained as a verified browser research path, with failed Python position-equivalence and all earlier evidence intact. Product scheduling, recovery, feasible initialization, expression/population extension and practical speed remain unfinished.

The added retained evidence is `ipc-oral-raw-target*`, `pucker-ipc-raw`, `ipc-wasm-{primitives,initial,diagnostic,initial-stack,raw-solved,browser-solved,state-probes,path-observation}`, `ipc-python-path-observation`, `ipc-raw-shape-comparison.json`, `ipc-wasm-shape-comparison.json` and `pucker-ipc-wasm`, with the C++/JavaScript port sources in `.shots/ipc-wasm-source`. Original binaries, failed commands, exact paths, generated GLBs, direct-review image hashes and runtime receipts remain available. These are research results outside the product dependency graph; canonical documents still do not invoke the joint solver.

The next cost reduction partitions complete IPC candidates by fixed/free ownership before closest-feature reduction. Under the default unweighted IPC collision set, the [native builder](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/blob/478876f30bf8ea768772dd8983c26a1a801ad976/src/ipc/collisions/normal/normal_collisions_builder.cpp) merges duplicate features by adding weights, allowing the fixed primitive contribution to be cached as a constant value and gradient. Edge mollifier dependence remains attached to all four original vertices. Mixed primitives stay variable even when their current closest feature contains only fixed vertices. An independent triangle's three states exercise that distinction: four, three and zero such reduced fixed features remain inside its variable contact population.

The fixed minimum distance is cached separately and combined with the variable minimum. Omitting it would change adaptive stiffness: this problem's initial full and variable-only minimum squared distances are 0.0001223382211930233 and 0.000816275845747897. Three independent states and nine actual trajectory states reproduce the full minimum exactly, free gradients exactly, and full barrier values within 3.37e-11. Six compiled small-mesh cases cover those changing features, all-free, all-fixed and empty-contact populations. Their 24 measurements and the preceding 22 numerical probes match exactly between Node and Chromium and across repeated calls. This derivation is limited to the stated IPC sum; it does not certify other collision-set formulations.

The complete optimized solve retains the same 122 accepted steps, every compared non-energy numerical decision, all thirteen saved intermediate coordinate arrays and the final array exactly. Energy summation changes only within the existing numerical comparison bound; contact diagnostics are explicitly renamed to count the repeatedly evaluated variable population. The original full-mesh CCD, objective, target, topology, fixed positions, adaptive stiffness and stopping rule remain unchanged. Node elapsed time falls from 152.94 to 107.09 seconds. A real Chromium worker exactly reproduces the new Node records and coordinates in 87.74 seconds versus the preceding 133.30 seconds. These are sequential single-run observations, not controlled repeated benchmarks. They remain too slow for per-slider editing.

Actual re-export yields byte-identical complete model, shared-surface and GLB files, retaining GLB `df7b0ce363c7769d8fd143b06ec824029f3f16e4a042fd587ead95cfe5aff644`. The preceding exact-contact census and 26 directly inspected views apply to this identical artifact; no new capture or additional likeness improvement is claimed. The separate Python position-equivalence failure remains preserved. A V8 profile of twelve early iterations observes 5.47 sampled seconds in full CCD within 11.54 seconds of solver steps, motivating the next investigation of immutable primitive pairs. Initialization and process work also appear in that profile, so it is not a steady-state browser cost model. The new evidence is `ipc-primitive-partition`, `ipc-wasm-constant-*` and `pucker-ipc-constant/identity-receipt.json`; both preceding and new source/runtime snapshots remain retained. Product integration and the previously listed whole-face obligations are still unfinished.

The following cost investigation compares full and fixed-filtered continuous collision queries on independent moving/stationary controls and ten recorded paths. Bounds remain exact, but filtering alone gives no convincing speed improvement. A stationary crossing is deliberately detected by full initial admission and missed by the filtered query, demonstrating why that admission cannot be removed. Native LBVH, HashGrid, SpatialHash and SweepAndPrune retain the same measured contact results; the alternatives are slower in these single observations. Those unfavorable results remain retained.

A research extension of the original public [LBVH broad-phase API](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/blob/478876f30bf8ea768772dd8983c26a1a801ad976/src/ipc/broad_phase/lbvh.cpp) starts queries only from moving primitives. Edge-edge candidates are the unique moving-edge/all-edge union. Face-vertex candidates are the disjoint moving-vertex/all-face and fixed-vertex/moving-face union. It retains native conservative bounds, topology exclusions and narrow-phase formulas. Fifteen compiled comparisons cover independent mixed/all-free/all-fixed/single-face cases, two actual states and five swept paths. Complete candidate sets match without duplicates, actual free-gradient differences are at most 7.11e-15, minima are exact, and all five same-endpoint CCD bounds are exact. Small all-free cases do not establish a universal speedup.

The full moving-query solve retains initial whole-surface admission, the fixed barrier/minimum contribution, the original target and convergence criterion. It converges after 122 accepted steps in 54.71 seconds versus 107.09 seconds for the constant-partition baseline. Final double coordinates differ by at most 9.385652e-9 mm, below the unchanged 0.0001-mm comparison threshold; fixed coordinates remain exact. Floating-point step records are no longer identical. A genuine browser worker reproduces all new Node records and final coordinates exactly in 61.21 seconds versus the earlier 87.74 seconds. These are single sequential observations, with other verification work overlapping the browser run, not a controlled timing benchmark or interactive-editor completion.

Although final solver coordinates are identical after Float32 transport, the actual product exporter regenerates downstream mouth geometry and normals. Complete GLB equality fails and is preserved as a failed expectation: one mouth-interior position component differs by 1.862645149e-9 metres and fifty normal components differ by at most 5.960464478e-8. Independent direct-primitive decoding confirms the difference; scene metadata and indices remain exact. The new GLB `32f20662dfc2c473dde116d13b4df59e00cd53854fcf8d7b7264d9599bbf61f6` receives its own complete four-material buffer comparisons, eight exact contact censuses and whole-skin audit of 54,752 triangles and 368,082 AABB pairs, all with zero forbidden crossings and all 134 opposing attachment edges retained.

All 26 new comparison views were directly inspected with the same explicit cameras and calibrated AMD GPU. Visible face and mouth form are retained without a new gross protrusion or lower-lid separation. Bulky orbital tissue, angular nasal base, uniform crowns, simplified interior and narrow cervical form remain. The acceleration adds no demonstrated likeness or anatomical refinement. New evidence is `ipc-fixed-ccd-probe`, `ipc-broad-phase-probe`, `ipc-moving-broad-phase-probe-v2`, `ipc-wasm-moving-{solved,browser}` and `pucker-ipc-moving`, including original source/runtime snapshots, failed identity checks and direct image review. Product integration, general feasible initialization, complete oral anatomy, expression/population coverage and the previously listed delivery obligations remain open.

At product source `a8d7d3f4`, the shared head preparation is separated from contact sealing, normal/material packing and dependent interiors. Nine actual expression models and GLBs remain byte-identical to their preceding outputs. The preceding read-only assembly investigation covers those nine states and 81 directly inspected GPU views; neither that observation nor the structural separation adds a new solved product path or likeness improvement.

A further read-only sealer observation identifies 39 native alias pairs in the closed state. The number of referenced vertices falls by 41: the remaining two removed vertices are the original shared commissure landmarks, whose opposing fold faces disappear. Thus reference-count reduction is not an alias count. In the actual mouth finisher, moving one shared solver point by 0.01 mm while updating only referenced native vertices leaves an upper/lower landmark pair inconsistent and recreates the cavity. Scattering to all explicitly equivalent vertices preserves closure. This is a state-propagation experiment for solver integration, not a physiological motion or a newly introduced product defect. Unreferenced semantic landmarks still require an explicit consumer policy.

The first native-ID assembly prototype incorrectly requires the entire compound to have at most two faces per edge. A census of the complete retained 64,410-triangle oral problem identifies 320 three-face edges. Every one contains two opposed enamel faces and one maxillary-tissue face, with both endpoints belonging to the two recorded component maps. The original prototype and its failed premise remain preserved. Its successor checks each source block's mapped edge incidence and winding, retains opposing winding at ordinary two-face compound seams, rejects duplicated assembled triangles, and records higher-incidence junctions with all contributing owners. It does not remove faces or exempt collision pairs. These conditions do not prove vertex-link manifoldness, embedding or anatomical validity.

Independent book, three-wing and closed-tetrahedron-plus-sheet examples distinguish ordinary seams from compound junctions; fifteen negative cases cover invalid identities, positions, triangles, winding, source incidence and scatter. The pinned [IPC collision-mesh constructor](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/blob/478876f30bf8ea768772dd8983c26a1a801ad976/src/ipc/collision_mesh.cpp) stores variable-length edge-to-face incidence. Its static predicate reports no intersection for the explicitly joined analytic examples and detects the undeclared coincident twin. This is evidence for the tested contact representation, not a general tissue attachment model.

The successor reconstructs all 32,243 original vertices, all 64,410 oriented triangles, the original target and all 1,801 free-vertex declarations exactly under a bijective renumbering. Original skin and component index buffers independently check the stored face partitions. Every target scatters back exactly to each native component, and reversing input block order preserves the assembly. This uses the previous research problem's saved identity maps without a new coordinate search; those old maps were originally constructed through declared-seam coordinate matching, so it does not establish a live product provider of native correspondence. Original and reconstructed static IPC predicates agree for initial, raw-target and previously solved coordinates in both double and Float32 metre transport: clear, intersecting and clear respectively. No new solve, convergence improvement or render claim follows from this permutation.

The retained evidence is `native-contact-aliases`, `native-consumer-complexes`, `native-complex-oracles.json`, `joint-edge-incidence.json`, `native-compound-oracles.json` and `native-complete-oral-compound`, together with their observation, assembly and admission scripts under the same investigation directory. The complete compound experiment preserves the earlier successful geometry and unfavorable hypotheses. Live component topology, semantic-landmark propagation, general feasible initialization, lower/posterior anatomy, editor integration, practical speed and the complete facial delivery remain unfinished.

The next product increment exposes owned native interior meshes before metric packing. After contact sealing, the actual head stages every selected provider before common skin normals and material regions. Upper enamel retains both observed-maxillary and refined-oral modes; lower enamel retains its one rigid jaw pose; the tongue retains weighted jaw motion and regenerated normals. The oral cavity and legacy crowns share the same native producer with the existing direct builder. An empty native result suppresses compatibility fallback, and parts retain their previous component order. This introduces no inverse unit conversion, coordinate-based identity reconstruction or new geometry formula.

Twelve complete models and GLBs reproduce their pre-change bytes: the nine representative expression states, the existing Miriam document with lower enamel, and two explicit lingual research variants of that document. The added tongue profile is an authored experiment, not a measured refit. Forty-three targeted canonical unit scenarios pass, with the slowest at 152 ms. A deliberate type-correct empty-provider fallback defect fails the named one-generation assertion; the same process restores the complete source bytes in finally. Baselines, output receipts and the negative witness remain in `native-interior-baseline`, `native-interior-equivalence`, `native-interior-regression.log` and `negative-native-interior.json` under the same investigation root. Native preparation is now consumed by the product; the joint solver, explicit lip/cervical correspondence and general feasible initialization remain unfinished. No new visual or likeness improvement is claimed for this output-preserving increment.

### Complete oral enclosure study

At product source `99c49d08`, a new read-only observation includes sealed skin and every currently prepared native oral interior. The legacy eye finishers are outside this population. Native IPC reports intersections in eight of nine representative states in both double head coordinates and Float32 metre transport; only closed passes. The observed legacy backdrop has 282 self contacts and 1,685 backdrop/enamel contacts in double coordinates. These edge/face counts include touching and do not measure penetration severity. The backdrop's sinusoidal depth retraces its commissural boundary; independent barycentric witnesses also establish interior backdrop/enamel intersections. Earlier skin-only or replacement-compound results do not certify this larger live population.

The new structural candidate replaces that backdrop with the retained fixed maxillary tissue, posterior-cheek upper vestibule and one floor/posterior disk attached to all 124 remaining directed boundary vertices. Live cervical IDs and the engine's original-input permutation reproduce the complete retained FEM maxillary mesh exactly. Current source lip IDs own the vestibular attachment; compound IDs generated in this same assembly own the cap. No coordinate search or previously saved global map constructs these joins. The complete observed compound contains 32,778 vertices, 65,602 triangles and the existing 320 enamel/tissue junctions. All non-backdrop source parts remain present and unchanged.

The floor is a bounded squared-Laplacian height field on chart `(x, z - 0.5 y)`, with fixed native boundary and three interior height pins. Its first height is an explicit study estimate, five millimetres below the observed lower lip minimum, not recovered anatomy. The unchanged prior maxillary margin and ridge also remain estimates. This initial complete enclosure has 421 floor/enamel edge/face contacts in both coordinate representations. Closing the topology alone therefore does not make a valid interior.

The successor keeps that domain, all pins, boundary coordinates, triangles and height bounds. It adds all 52,298 projected floor/enamel overlap inequalities, including already clear witnesses, to the same bending minimization. With height `h`, each row requires the interpolated floor height to remain at least 0.05 mm inferior to the enamel plane. This is separation along the chart's Y coordinate, not a clinical thickness or Euclidean-distance claim. No enamel triangle is parallel to this particular projection. The existing engine's complete projected-triangle clipping supplies the rows, and its quadratic solver returns status 1, maximum row violation 3.64e-12 and minimum remeasured height clearance 0.0500000000000847 mm. Maximum floor-point movement is 4.340458 mm. Four independent one-unknown cases and a contradictory fixed-row refusal verify the added constraint elimination; earlier FEM element and affine-field oracles still pass.

Full native IPC admission now reports zero intersections in double and Float32 metre transport. An independent final-Float32 integer-plane/Fraction census checks all 13,565 overlapping AABB pairs involving the floor against itself and every other compound face: 3,542 are disjoint, 10,023 meet only on explicitly shared native features, and none intersects beyond those features. Equal coordinates without shared IDs remain a rejected contact in the independent unlinked-twin oracle. This census validates the new floor's consequence surface; it is not an independent exhaustive certificate for every unchanged face pair.

The main agent directly inspected all 46 calibrated AMD Radeon 8060S GPU captures for the unconstrained and constrained comparisons, including paired front, oblique, profile, back, lower, reference-aligned and clay views plus isolated interior views. The constrained floor no longer exposes lateral enamel through its underside. The visible lip, enamel and face exterior are retained, with changed interior occlusion. The large simplified posterior/floor form, absent lower dentition and tongue in this representative, bulky lids, angular nasal base and existing likeness limitations remain. This establishes an observed-pose enclosure candidate, not complete anatomical reconstruction, other-expression acceptance or a new product solver path.

The original failed backdrop, unconstrained cap, constrained candidate, input documents, numerical rows, GLBs, source versions, failed capture-path command and complete captures remain under `.shots/human-2469/investigation-2498/`, in `live-oral-boundaries/`, `joint-consumer-stage-trace/`, `complete-oral-enclosure/`, `complete-oral-enclosure-constrained/` and their adjacent scripts and logs. The source scripts are `build-complete-oral-enclosure.mjs`, `complete-oral-floor-study.mjs`, `constrain-complete-oral-floor.mjs`, `verify-height-contact-rows.mjs`, `audit-complete-oral-enclosure.py`, `exact-complete-oral-floor.py` and `capture-complete-oral-enclosure.mjs`; preceding maxillary and FEM implementations are preserved beside their successors. Actual mandibular attachment, closed correspondence, expression coverage, lower-enamel/tongue cases and live product integration remain required before adoption.

### Reference-localized joint expression study

The complete enclosure has six clear static states: observed, closed, intermediate and maximum jaw opening, and intermediate and maximum lip separation. Strong pucker, smile and asymmetric corner movement make the single-height representation infeasible. Exact rational witnesses bound each constraint row using its fixed boundary and admissible interior height interval; an independent linear program also reports infeasibility. The greatest row deficits are 1.98033 mm for pucker and 7.70505 mm for smile/asymmetry. Raising the iteration budget or moving only the bounded interior height variables cannot satisfy these rows. These failed candidates and their certificates remain preserved.

The successor transports the same complete observed topology in all three coordinates through the actual skin displacement and jaw owners. It fixes maxillary tissue and enamel, and jointly solves the changing skin, vestibule and floor. Its objective combines area-weighted target fitting, symmetric Dirichlet distortion, target-dihedral bending and native IPC contact. The 14 mm regularization length is a geometric study setting, not a measured tissue modulus. The first pucker solve removed 864 raw-target edge/face contacts but exhausted 180 iterations and moved the nearly stationary right eyelid up to 2.078057 mm away from its target. Preserving contact alone was insufficient.

The subsequent energy decomposition reproduces the original WASM initial gradient to relative norm error 2.28e-13. The right eyelid's initial contact-gradient norm is 25,521.1, compared with position 0.00104, strain 0.767 and bending 138.220. A no-op target equal to the initial surface isolates the resulting rest force: the original formulation moves the mesh by up to 0.431967 mm on its first step. The [Geometric Contact Potential paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.00719v3) identifies this class of spurious IPC rest forces. Its orientation and local-distance formulation is a separate investigated alternative; this successor does not implement GCP.

The controlled successor changes the classic barrier's activation radius from 0.384870 mm to half the actual smallest positive initial nonincident clearance, 0.001106589 mm. Every initial barrier value and gradient is then zero. Fixed/free ownership, triangles, targets, regularization and continuous collision detection remain unchanged; native stiffness initialization still owns the stiffness value. The no-op solve converges without a step and preserves every coordinate exactly. A global radius derived from the smallest feature remains sensitive to that feature and does not establish a general optimal contact discretization.

All three performed problems converge under the retained maximum-Newton-direction criterion of 1e-6 mm: pucker in 139 iterations, smile in 83 and asymmetry in 49. Their measured wall times are 303.57, 183.67 and 114.21 seconds, with partly concurrent execution, so these are not isolated runtime benchmarks. All fixed points retain their exact coordinates. Full native compound admission reports no intersection for any terminal state in either double millimetres or Float32 metre transport. The raw targets had 864, 814 and 355 edge/face contacts respectively. These counts describe this compound, not omitted eye finishers, continuous exported animation or anatomical accuracy.

An independent integer-plane/Fraction census additionally checks every terminal Float32 compound triangle against the complete population. Pucker, smile and asymmetry have 467,385, 458,968 and 457,134 inclusive AABB candidate pairs respectively. Each contains 403,204 contacts confined to explicitly shared native features; every other pair is disjoint, with zero forbidden intersections. The existing analytic triangle, undeclared coincident-twin, junction and broad-phase oracles run first, and the earlier floor census reproduces its complete counts and witnesses exactly. `exact-joint-compound.py` calls the same preserved census owner through an import-safe entry point, rather than copying its predicate. `all-aabb-exact.json` in each diagnostic directory retains all counts and compound digests. This exhaustive static result still does not certify continuous animation or omitted components.

Pucker's maximum right-eyelid target error falls from 2.078057 to 0.012115 mm, and the left from 0.905862 to 0.010243 mm. Their RMS errors fall to 0.005090 and 0.001241 mm. The right/left maximum errors are 0.004230/0.001010 mm for smile and 0.000465/0.001009 mm for asymmetry. The eyes remain in the same free-vertex and collision populations. Oral target fidelity remains imperfect: maximum lip errors are 2.57337, 1.16730 and 1.11258 mm, and floor errors are 3.75291, 4.59452 and 3.53155 mm respectively. These are target-preservation measurements, not photographic likeness scores.

The main agent directly inspected all 63 calibrated AMD Radeon 8060S captures, covering initial, unconstrained target and terminal candidate in front, both obliques, both profiles, below and clay views for each expression. The old and new pucker candidates also share all seven cameras, GPU and calibration. The new candidate removes visible lateral tooth protrusion without the earlier eyelid distortion; the smile and asymmetric corner movements remain readable. Bulky underlying eyelids, the angular nasal base, simplified enamel, absent lower enamel/tongue in this representative and existing likeness limitations remain. These diagnostic exports deliberately contain only the native compound, excluding legacy eye finishers, hair and vertex colours.

The retained successors are `rest-locality-{pucker,smile,asymmetric}-solved` and the corresponding `-diagnostic` directories under `.shots/human-2469/investigation-2498/`. Their problem inputs, all solver iterates, binary solutions, native double/Float32 admissions, regional measurements, GLBs and captures remain beside the unfavorable original solve and exact no-op controls. `diagnose-joint-region-energy.py`, `prepare-rest-locality.py`, `measure-joint-regions.py`, `export-complete-oral-joint.mjs` and `capture-joint-compound.mjs` own the reproducible research steps; the original WASM source and binary are preserved in `ipc-before-rest-locality`. This improved formulation becomes the basis for subsequent integration. It is not yet called by the face editor; general feasible initialization, full component coverage, practical performance and the remaining facial work are still required.

2026-09-15 dental update: adjust four individual upper-crown heights and the two central crowns’ proximal incisal contours, and author a separate lower row through the existing mandibular component. The previous numerical basis, reference, expression, appearance, hair and every non-dental part are retained. Two whole source builds reproduce identical models and 7,630,744-byte GLBs. The cached component contrast differs from canonical model JSON only in part insertion order; its GLB is byte-identical.

The main agent directly inspected all ten observed-pose views below and three angles each for neutral, lip-only and 10-degree jaw states on AMD Radeon 8060S/ANGLE. Central incisal exposure and the previously absent lower-tooth strip are closer to the source. Flat-looking enamel, dark cervical gaps without gingiva, lateral crown contours and the existing orbital, nasal, skin and hair discrepancies remain. This is a partial dental improvement, not accepted likeness.

Neutral anterior-enclosure sampling finds no uncovered or protruding tooth points among 65,416 vertices, triangle centres and edge midpoints. Opposing-arch depth-envelope samples find no overlap in observed, neutral, lip-only or 10-degree jaw states. The upper row stays fixed; lower enamel remains fixed under lip-only movement and follows the authored hinge under jaw rotation. These finite samples are not complete triangle intersection or physiological occlusion certificates.

Before the reference-continuation change, a 25-degree jaw with lipPart 12 failed cervical construction in both the preceding public document and the dental revision. The isolated facial-performance collar reached Y=-113.820 mm while the upper cervical section remained at Y=-107 mm. This was a shared assembly failure rather than a dental regression.

The subsequent 2026-09-15 source update constructs cranial and cervical continuation in the reference frame, then poses only its appended vertices. The observed artifact remains exact and its authored neck is unchanged. Two source builds each at 12.5 and 25 degrees reproduce exact models and GLBs. The main agent directly inspected all ten GPU views of each state, including both profiles, clay and source-pose framing. The shared lips remain connected; the maximum still has a deep submental fold, an empty-looking oral cavity and simplified enamel. These are construction and continuity observations, not physiological or likeness acceptance.

The 12.5-degree GLB has 7,630,744 bytes and SHA-256 `0f9a3b3b53d8bd6d0cad9aa88239477bacbbdc78f9deccecfe251ec0e7681684`; the 25-degree GLB has 7,630,740 bytes and SHA-256 `ca8d0f8ff7c87dab2b0cf8d2f21cf5e2809758966a4bcdc3c4c1fa965d4b60bf`. Their capture directories are `.shots/human-2469/subject-jaw-continuation-{half,maximum}/generated-black-boy-01`. The actual editor's calibrated GPU check verifies midpoint/endpoint edits, 25.1-degree refusal with document retention, exact undo/redo and JSON save, and a downloaded maximum GLB identical to that source artifact. Ten related native unit scenarios pass; this is not the whole change's Self-Review or CI gate.

The following hair-only and original face-only records are historical.

Direct source/render comparison: excessive white-eye exposure, heavy regular brows and overly even visible tooth row. Preserve observed facial proportions; reduce identity lid opening and brow fibre mass, move lateral crowns posteriorly and lift the fixed upper row.

Front and reference show a broad smiling mouth, individually constructed upper crowns and dark iris pigmentation. Both obliques and clay still expose regular lower-lid shelves and a simplified angular alar/columellar transition. Both profiles and back show the shared inferred cranial and neck form, including posterior lobulation. The final exported face was inspected after the editor shadow-bias correction; absence of the prior WebGL shadow acne does not make the anatomy or likeness accepted.

2026-09-14 hair update: replace the large coiled strips with 1,024 rooted surface patches and a saved curled alpha/normal profile. Seeded tangent directions and centred footprints reduce the large crown gap visible in the preceding uniform-direction trial. Two whole source builds produce identical models and 7,461,304-byte GLBs. Every non-hair part, the facial appearance, expression, basis and reference remain unchanged from the preceding brow-depth5 document. The changed fixture is a partial hair improvement, not a new likeness acceptance.

The main agent directly opened all ten views listed below from the actual exported GLB on AMD Radeon 8060S/ANGLE. Front/reference have a fuller hair envelope but retain an unnaturally sharp fringe; obliques, profiles and back still show broad patches rather than the photographed tight curls. Clay retains the existing orbital, nasal and lip discrepancies. A dark upper-hair occupancy comparison gives IoU 0.838/0.852/0.849 for source brightness thresholds 60/70/80, excluding eyebrows and lower temples. These are occupancy measurements, not overall likeness scores. At 100,352 Float32-equivalent hair vertices and triangle centroids, radial head-clearance samples are outside the skin with a minimum of 0.757 mm. Finite sampling is not a complete triangle collision certificate.

2026-09-16 optical partial adoption: the current document sets `sphereFit: observation-ray`, `opticalFrame: radial`, `canthalSupport: tangent` and `surfaceRadius: 12`. All other authored values, source identity and observed expression remain exact. Two independent complete builds reproduce the retained candidate's model and GLB exactly. The spherical radius is an authored approximation at human-eye scale, not person-specific biometry. [Adult CT measurements](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4238270/) describe varying, unequal axes; [juvenile longitudinal biometry](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23575156/) measures axial growth. Neither establishes a universal 12-mm spherical radius or a radius recoverable from this photograph. The fixed-canthus hull is geometric support, not a measured conjunctival surface.

All nine views in each of observed, bilateral blink and oral-gaze were directly inspected: 27 views for this person, under AMD hardware rendering with an independently specified 10-mm calibration cube (45 expected pixels, 44 measured). The open-eye curvature and glints improve, but the inferior-lid band/shadow remains more pronounced than baseline and the superior orbital hollow is excessive. The smile retains regular crowns and a thick vermilion band. Both profiles retain the angular nose and neck; the rear groom exposes a central separation and small crown gaps. These are unresolved form observations, not changes attributed to the eye controls. In full blink the optical apertures are covered; that sampled closure does not validate natural blink motion. The optical improvement is adopted while the coupled tissue work continues; **whole-face likeness remains unaccepted**.

The following entries preserve preceding revisions and their own artifact identities; their use of “current” refers to those earlier checkpoints.

Direct comparison of all nine initial views with the original: eyelid margins are too widely separated, brow fibres read as a solid ribbon, upper dental exposure is too regular and the tip projects too strongly. Hidden rear shape remains inferred.

The final front/reference retain the selected smile and dark optical palette. Both obliques reveal the simplified lid roll and lip band; the dental row remains too uniform. Both profiles keep the pinnae against the head silhouette, while back and clay reveal the shared inferred posterior head and neck lobes. The source hair is not reproduced by this face-only editor.

All nine views in each of observed, bilateral blink and oral-gaze were directly inspected: 27 views for this person, under AMD hardware rendering with an independently specified 10-mm calibration cube (45 expected pixels, 44 measured). The open-eye globes read as curved reflective volumes. The lower-lid band is more apparent than baseline, while the broad upper lid and medial orbital depth remain unlike the reference. Both profiles show the inferred shallow jaw-to-neck transition; rear hair remains a regular cap. Block-like incisors and the lip band persist in observed and open-mouth views. In full blink the optical apertures are covered; that sampled closure does not validate natural blink motion.

The following entries preserve preceding revisions and their own artifact identities; their use of “current” refers to those earlier checkpoints.

The original has less white-eye exposure, lighter tapered brows, a thinner lower vermilion and rounded incisal tips. Adjust those profiles without changing the observation's pose or ethnicity.

The broad smile and upper row are present in front and reference, but the crowns are block-like and regular. Both obliques and clay expose the thin regular inferior-lid roll, strip-like brows and angular columella. Both profiles and back show the inferred cranial/neck continuation rather than measured hidden anatomy. A proposed smaller eye opening was rejected by the orientation guard; the guard was retained and that one fit proposal was withdrawn.

[Replay document](generated-korean-girl-01.json) · [Original selection and quality](inputs.md#input-generated-korean-girl-01). Selected original: `generated-korean-girl-age-16.png`.

Frozen first-hour identity; this human build isolates the face from the earlier hair-context study.

The first-hour fit is frozen, not extended by the package extraction. Front and source-pose views retain the measured smiling arrangement, but the lid bands, angular nostril base, lip contour and regular crowns remain visibly synthetic. Both obliques and profiles show attached ears and a continuous face-to-neck silhouette; that continuity does not validate the inferred posterior anatomy. Back and clay expose the generic cranial/neck continuation. Hair was omitted from this isolated human build; the separate capped legacy study retains its coarse hair. Neutral and wink/open-jaw diagnostics were also directly inspected, but do not certify every expression combination.

## jang-su-hye {#jang-su-hye}

[Replay document](jang-su-hye.json) · [Original selection and quality](inputs.md#input-jang-su-hye). Selected original: `jang-su-hye_age-approx-31_symposium-portrait.jpeg`.

Reference-view comparison shows an overly thick lower vermilion, broad bright eye aperture and coarse brows. The selected portrait has makeup and limited face pixels; do not convert those lighting limits into guessed skin detail.

Front and reference preserve the closed lip seam without exposed enamel in this pose. Both obliques and clay show flat, simplified nostril form, regular lid bands and insufficiently individualized brow distribution. Both profiles and back retain the inferred skull, pinnae and posterior neck lobes. This adult original was explicitly selected over the small childhood group-frame faces; no claim is made that the adult settings reproduce those other ages.

## kim-min-jung {#kim-min-jung}

[Replay document](kim-min-jung.json) · [Original selection and quality](inputs.md#input-kim-min-jung). Selected original: `kim-min-jung_age-26_strike-love.jpg`.

The photograph's closed smile does not show the tiny white dental strip admitted by the detector-derived aperture. Close the performance seam explicitly, reduce overly bright eye exposure and excessive lower-lip thickness; retain the low-light source qualification.

The closed mouth remains closed in front and reference, but the vermilion band is too heavy. Obliques and clay expose pinched inner under-eye wedges and an angular nasal base. Profiles and back show the shared inferred cranial and neck shape. The event photograph's lighting cannot establish linear skin albedo or hidden depth.

2026-09-15 aperture revision: removing the common `eye.openingScale` override of 0.93 restores the unchanged observation recipe's 1.025. Actual projected lid-boundary height divided by the recorded observation changes from right 0.91410 / left 0.89907 to right 1.00009 / left 0.99133; width ratios are right 0.99318 / left 0.99319. These measurements describe aperture, not likeness or certainty about photograph-derived anatomy. The complete observed model and GLB repeat exactly in two independent source builds; basis, reference, caller and all materials remain exact. The observed GLB is 7,012,312 bytes, SHA-256 `b8bf128dab525481946d8850450b252857db9ba4141457c58b06f04127e2b0a6`.

All thirteen observed views and the fresh baseline reference comparison were directly inspected under the same directional light and camera procedure. Neutral, half-blink and full blink were independently built and captured in thirteen views each; front, right profile and clay oblique were directly inspected for each state. The opening narrows at half-blink and the lids meet at full blink in these views. Neutral clears every expression channel, whereas both blink documents retain the observed closed-smile channels. The thick superior orbital hood, sharp nasal base, uniform skin, simplified lip contour and blunt centre-part hair remain unlike the source. Only the aperture improvement is adopted; likeness remains **unaccepted**. Current capture directory: `.shots/human-2469/subject-eye-observation-opening/lee-tae-ri`.

The rebuilt actual editor selects the current document from nineteen built-in choices. Observed, neutral, half-blink and blink each save exact JSON and export byte-identical GLBs against their independent source builds. Undo restores the observed document even though its lip separation is zero. All four editor fronts were directly inspected out of twenty-four captured views, with AMD 8060S hardware rendering and no page errors. This verifies the authored states and export path, not a natural blink trajectory or full likeness. The local editor record is `.shots/human-2469/eye-opening-built-in-lee-tae-ri/receipt.json`; its inherited prose mentions eighteen captures, while its four state entries and six saved angles per state record twenty-four.

The following face-only observations and artifact identities are historical and do not identify the current hair-bearing aperture revision.

Compared directly with the event photograph: broad white eye exposure and smooth exaggerated lip bands dominate the initial reconstruction. Narrow those anatomical bands, soften fibre mass and retain the observed closed smile.

The explicit chin-frame adjustment reaches the final geometry, and front/reference retain a closed smile. Eye shape, lip contour and cheek support remain generalized. Obliques and clay expose the regular orbital bands; profiles and back retain inferred jaw depth and posterior lobes. A numerical chin displacement is an effective control, not proof that the photographed chin has been recovered.

2026-09-16 joint-placement partial adoption: the current replay document uses upper-arch lift 1.2672524293631948 mm and recess 7.449994597102961 mm. These values couple the source-pixel incisal fit to the union of tooth/head/lip contact constraints across observed, neutral and oral-gaze states. All non-dental model parts and materials remain exact; the upper arch remains fixed across the three expressions. Final Float32 tooth versus head/lip surface checks find zero intersecting triangle pairs in all three states. This does not certify the unrepaired legacy oral backdrop or continuous motion.

All 27 candidate views and their 27 retained baseline counterparts were directly read for this person. The observed crown band is closer to the photograph, and the prior candidate’s new neutral commissure enamel is absent in the reviewed views. The actual source-replayed legacy-cavity model changes the sampled visible-incisal mean absolute error from 1.8667 to 0.4167 native pixels, with 1-pixel manual reference uncertainty and 0.25-pixel sampling. This fitted-column result is not whole-face accuracy. The replacement-cavity experiments are separately retained and are not silently included in this adoption.

All three new actual-editor fronts were directly read. Saved/reloaded JSON is exact and neutral undo restores the same-browser original GLB exactly. Across all four people, eight source/browser GLBs match exactly; three Alan states and Oh observed each differ in one NORMAL Float32 component by one ULP, with every other byte exact. The new receipt records those differences without claiming cross-runtime byte identity. Hardware rendering is AMD 8060S; the editor calibration cube measures the expected 16 pixels. The open-mouth state still exposes missing lower interior and the legacy backdrop. Heavy orbital volume, simple alar form, angular face/neck planes and likeness remain unresolved. **The placement improvement is adopted; full oral anatomy and whole-face likeness are not accepted.**

The following unrestricted placement trial and older observations retain their own artifact identities and limitations.

2026-09-16 maxillary placement candidate under joint review: a one-millimetre source-builder probe establishes the rigid upper-arch translation and its derivative in the recorded photograph frame. The median signed incisal residual gives one placement candidate. The retained trial document changes only `detail.dentition.placement.lift` from 4.4 to 1.8574765689179449 mm. Crown shape, aperture, material, camera, reference and all other authored values stay exact. Every non-dental model part is unchanged in observed, neutral and oral-gaze states; the upper arch is identical across these three states.

At 3 directly read source-image columns, mean absolute visible-incisal position error changes from 1.8667 to 0.4167 native pixels. Manual photograph-reading uncertainty is 1 pixels and final Float32 triangle sampling uses a 0.25-pixel step. These are fitted-column observations, not held-out anatomical accuracy or a likeness percentage. The readings distinguish visible enamel from total crown height and lip aperture; the [tooth-display study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20111761/) supplies that observation distinction, not this person's dimensions or a cohort value to impose.

The main agent directly read all nine views of both current and candidate in all three states: 54 images for this person. Hardware rendering used AMD Radeon 8060S with an independently specified 10-mm cube (45 expected pixels, 44 measured). The exposed upper crown band gains height and approaches the photograph. The initial review missed a small new enamel patch at the anatomical right commissure in neutral; the actual editor and reopened front/oblique captures expose it. Dental individuality, absent lower interior, optical aperture, angular nose and hair volume remain unresolved. The fitted-column improvement remains an experiment while the shared oral-space correction continues. **Whole-face likeness and complete oral anatomy remain unaccepted.** Finite visible-surface queries and sampled views do not certify continuous collision freedom.

Subsequent joint-contact audit: actual final Float32 upper-enamel versus head/lips intersects in observed 44 to 105, neutral 0 to 106, oral-gaze 39 to 73 triangle pairs; versus the legacy oral backdrop, observed 674 to 876, neutral 0 to 0, oral-gaze 546 to 560 pairs. These counts are intersection witnesses, not penetrated area or an anatomical severity score. Closed neutral has no oral-backdrop mesh. All four candidates expose the same deficient interior representation; improving a photographed incisal line does not resolve it. The review preserves all candidates and research, and does not claim the oral group is complete. Full interval and endpoint records are retained under `.shots/human-2469/investigation-2498/oral-state-contact` and `oral-cavity-contact`. The 12-state actual editor check reproduces every saved JSON, with four exact undo cycles. Eight GLBs match source bytes exactly; three Alan states and Oh observed each differ only by one Float32 normal component at one ULP, with all other bytes exact.

The following records retain their preceding revisions and artifact identities.

The small selected original supports a narrower eye aperture and less lower vermilion than the initial render. Reduce brow mass, lower-lid relief and the exaggerated oral band; depth and hidden orbit remain low-confidence because of the fringe and pixel count.

The smiling front/reference contain a wide, regular upper dental row and a broad dark oral gap. Both obliques and clay still show an over-regular inferior-lid shelf, heavy vermilion and simplified angular nasal openings. Profiles and back retain the common inferred skull/neck. An eye-opening reduction was refused by the orientation guard and removed from the proposed fit without weakening admission.

The reference has a smaller closed vermilion band, a less protruding lower-lid shelf and softer brows than the reconstruction. Keep the existing measured closed seam and unobserved skull declaration.

Front and reference retain a thin closed lip band with no exposed teeth in this pose. Both obliques and clay reveal overly even lower lids, an outer roll and a simplified narrow tip. Profiles and back show the inferred cranial/neck continuation. The photographed closed-mouth likeness remains unaccepted despite clean numerical replay.

2026-09-16 representative-first depth adoption: the current document applies brow projection −3.6 mm, nasal depth scale 0.675 and oral seam advance 1.4366575 mm. A finite five-way experiment kept the photograph, registration, eye optical identity, aperture inputs, hair, material and expression fixed, comparing the baseline, each individual change and their combination. The seam trial used half the measured 2.873315 mm central outer-border/seam gap. These are explicit authored sensitivity choices, not published anatomical normal values or recovery of a hidden profile.

All 45 observed-state views and all 90 baseline/candidate performed views were directly inspected: front, both obliques, both profiles, back, clay, clay oblique and registered reference; performed states were neutral, half-blink, full blink, unilateral wink and oral/gaze. Reduced broad upper orbital shading, reduced nasal projection and less abrupt oral-junction shading coexist. Half/full closure and unilateral opening remain visible. The actual Float32 head anterior bound moves back by 5.629189 mm, and corresponding lip vertices move at most 1.367815 mm; these measure geometry response, not likeness error. Lower-lid bands, slightly pouting neutral lips, incomplete oral backdrop, regular hair cards and whole-face likeness remain unresolved. **Adopt the visible partial depth improvement; do not treat this as full likeness acceptance or a universal default.**

Independent final Float32 triangle checks find zero enamel/head-or-lip surface intersections in observed plus five performed states for both baseline and candidate (12 models). They do not certify oral-chamber thickness, hidden anatomy or continuous motion. The actual AMD editor saves exact numerical JSON and exports exact source GLBs for baseline, candidate and candidate neutral. A zero nasal-depth input is refused while retaining the last-valid document/GLB; neutral undo restores both exactly. All six before/after panel-refactor editor fronts were read and their corresponding PNG, JSON and GLB bytes are exact.

Current document semantic SHA-256 (JSON.stringify): `d88364152a33473b8de3b5cbcfcef64c20d9329770515de254be1c9d5cd9152c`; reviewed observed model: `aff74662c266e9c8ce55e933c4de31454185331ad0c76a5082cfb0c5062b68f7`; GLB: `7c69a50986d058ed74db44fc17fcbd0d910acd1d1f7ec193e396520df006933e`. Source baseline is `8e40ae30`; the subsequent validator extraction preserves these exact model/export values. Retained inputs, competing candidates, receipts and failure logs: `.shots/human-2469/investigation-2498/representative-depth`, `representative-performed`, `representative-depth-adoption`, and `representative-editor-{before,after}`. `panel-editor-equivalence.json` completes the actual browser comparison after its original harness encountered undefined DOM properties omitted by JSON. The original failed receipt remains preserved.

The entries below retain their historical revisions and do not describe the current depth settings or current model bytes.

2026-09-16 joint-placement partial adoption: the current replay document uses upper-arch lift 3.169522070272549 mm and recess 7 mm. These values couple the source-pixel incisal fit to the union of tooth/head/lip contact constraints across observed, neutral and oral-gaze states. All non-dental model parts and materials remain exact; the upper arch remains fixed across the three expressions. Final Float32 tooth versus head/lip surface checks find zero intersecting triangle pairs in all three states. This does not certify the unrepaired legacy oral backdrop or continuous motion.

All 27 candidate views and their 27 retained baseline counterparts were directly read for this person. The exposed upper band is slightly closer to the photograph; the change remains within manual reading uncertainty. The actual source-replayed legacy-cavity model changes the sampled visible-incisal mean absolute error from 0.95 to 0.70 native pixels, with 1.2-pixel manual reference uncertainty and 0.25-pixel sampling. This fitted-column result is not whole-face accuracy. The replacement-cavity experiments are separately retained and are not silently included in this adoption.

All three new actual-editor fronts were directly read. Saved/reloaded JSON is exact and neutral undo restores the same-browser original GLB exactly. Across all four people, eight source/browser GLBs match exactly; three Alan states and Oh observed each differ in one NORMAL Float32 component by one ULP, with every other byte exact. The new receipt records those differences without claiming cross-runtime byte identity. Hardware rendering is AMD 8060S; the editor calibration cube measures the expected 16 pixels. The open-mouth state still exposes missing lower interior and the legacy backdrop. Heavy orbital volume, simple alar form, angular face/neck planes and likeness remain unresolved. **The placement improvement is adopted; full oral anatomy and whole-face likeness are not accepted.**

The following unrestricted placement trial and older observations retain their own artifact identities and limitations.

2026-09-16 maxillary placement candidate under joint review: a one-millimetre source-builder probe establishes the rigid upper-arch translation and its derivative in the recorded photograph frame. The median signed incisal residual gives one placement candidate. The retained trial document changes only `detail.dentition.placement.lift` from 4.1 to 3.169522070272549 mm. Crown shape, aperture, material, camera, reference and all other authored values stay exact. Every non-dental model part is unchanged in observed, neutral and oral-gaze states; the upper arch is identical across these three states.

At 3 directly read source-image columns, mean absolute visible-incisal position error changes from 0.9500 to 0.7000 native pixels. Manual photograph-reading uncertainty is 1.2 pixels and final Float32 triangle sampling uses a 0.25-pixel step. These are fitted-column observations, not held-out anatomical accuracy or a likeness percentage. The readings distinguish visible enamel from total crown height and lip aperture; the [tooth-display study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20111761/) supplies that observation distinction, not this person's dimensions or a cohort value to impose.

The main agent directly read all nine views of both current and candidate in all three states: 54 images for this person. Hardware rendering used AMD Radeon 8060S with an independently specified 10-mm cube (45 expected pixels, 44 measured). A small increase in visible crown height is closer to the central photographed band; one outer sampled column moves past its former match. The aggregate change is within manual source-reading uncertainty. Neutral appearance is unchanged, and both profiles show no new exposed crossing. Large upper-lid hood, lower-lid shadow, angular nose and empty lower oral interior persist. The fitted-column improvement remains an experiment while the shared oral-space correction continues. **Whole-face likeness and complete oral anatomy remain unaccepted.** Finite visible-surface queries and sampled views do not certify continuous collision freedom.

Subsequent joint-contact audit: actual final Float32 upper-enamel versus head/lips intersects in observed 0 to 0, neutral 0 to 0, oral-gaze 0 to 0 triangle pairs; versus the legacy oral backdrop, observed 1179 to 1275, neutral 0 to 0, oral-gaze 844 to 846 pairs. These counts are intersection witnesses, not penetrated area or an anatomical severity score. Closed neutral has no oral-backdrop mesh. All four candidates expose the same deficient interior representation; improving a photographed incisal line does not resolve it. The review preserves all candidates and research, and does not claim the oral group is complete. Full interval and endpoint records are retained under `.shots/human-2469/investigation-2498/oral-state-contact` and `oral-cavity-contact`. The 12-state actual editor check reproduces every saved JSON, with four exact undo cycles. Eight GLBs match source bytes exactly; three Alan states and Oh observed each differ only by one Float32 normal component at one ULP, with all other bytes exact.

The following records retain their preceding revisions and artifact identities.

2026-09-16 optical partial adoption: the current document sets `sphereFit: observation-ray`, `opticalFrame: radial`, `canthalSupport: tangent` and `surfaceRadius: 12`. All other authored values, source identity and observed expression remain exact. Two independent complete builds reproduce the retained candidate's model and GLB exactly. The spherical radius is an authored approximation at human-eye scale, not person-specific biometry. [Adult CT measurements](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4238270/) describe varying, unequal axes; [juvenile longitudinal biometry](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23575156/) measures axial growth. Neither establishes a universal 12-mm spherical radius or a radius recoverable from this photograph. The fixed-canthus hull is geometric support, not a measured conjunctival surface.

All nine views in each of observed, bilateral blink and oral-gaze were directly inspected: 27 views for this person, under AMD hardware rendering with an independently specified 10-mm calibration cube (45 expected pixels, 44 measured). The open-eye reflection and rounded globe are clearer than the baseline's flatter optics. Lower-lid protrusion and shadow remain more prominent, and the superior orbital body is excessive. The profiles retain angular nasal, jaw and cervical planes; the rear groom remains a regular cap. The open-mouth diagnostic retains an overly regular upper row and sparse interior. In full blink the optical apertures are covered; that sampled closure does not validate natural blink motion. The optical improvement is adopted while the coupled tissue work continues; **whole-face likeness remains unaccepted**.

The following entries preserve preceding revisions and their own artifact identities; their use of “current” refers to those earlier checkpoints.

2026-09-15 fringe revision: the final 96 hair-card guides and their transverse frames now sweep laterally toward hand-observed fringe endpoints. The other 312 cards, every non-hair part, all materials including generated hair textures, identity basis, reference and expression remain exact. Two independent complete source builds and GLB exports are byte-identical. The adopted GLB is 7,217,076 bytes, SHA-256 `d145d95049dd7d4f4f93644aa9ebbce470f831ca40ee754dd9e5ecb9677af7c6`. The other eighteen subject documents remain byte-identical across this adoption.

All thirteen observed views were directly inspected, together with the previous reference comparison, rear view and right profile. The fringe flows sideways instead of ending in vertical spikes, but its uniform clumps, broad crown strips, crown gap and patterned shadows remain artificial. The directional-light view still exposes the unresolved orbital volume, uniform brown skin, simplified nose and mouth. This is a partial hair improvement, not a likeness acceptance. Current capture directory: `.shots/human-2469/subject-fringe-contour-visible/yoo-seung-ho`.

The six hand-observed image columns are a sparse 2D fringe-boundary study, not an anatomical or likeness score. Fitting nominal guide endpoints first left the alpha-tested visible boundary too high. After an 8.5-image-pixel nominal extension, the last-fragment residual is 0.73 to 2.18 pixels in magnitude, but a fractional-pixel translation probe exposes up to 2.10 pixels of sampling sensitivity. A separate lock-body boundary, defined by a four-image-pixel-wide, three-raster-row box at 25 percent occupancy, has residuals of 0.35 to 3.31 pixels and a maximum 0.43-pixel shift error for this candidate. Both measures follow an exact seventeen-raster-row translation exactly. These observed probe results do not establish a universal uncertainty bound; the manual photograph annotation has its own uncertainty. The records retain both measures rather than presenting the unstable fragment residual as subpixel accuracy.

Neutral, half-blink and full blink were independently rebuilt and captured in thirteen views each; front, right profile and clay oblique were directly inspected for each. Their non-hair parts exactly match the corresponding pre-fringe expression, and their hair part exactly matches the observed candidate. The original lip separation remains in the blink documents. The rebuilt actual editor selects the new document from nineteen built-in choices. Observed, neutral, half-blink and blink save exact JSON and export byte-identical GLBs against their independent source builds; undo restores the observed document. Four editor fronts were directly inspected out of twenty-four captured views. AMD 8060S rendering, a measured 16-pixel calibration cube and zero page errors are recorded in `.shots/human-2469/yoo-fringe-built-in/receipt.json`. This verifies these authored states, not natural motion or likeness. The editor paragraph below records the earlier aperture revision.

The following aperture measurements and editor record precede the fringe revision. The eye values remain adopted, but their recorded GLBs do not identify the current groom.

2026-09-15 aperture revision: removing the common `eye.openingScale` override of 0.89 restores the unchanged observation recipe's 1.025. Actual projected lid-boundary height divided by the recorded observation changes from right 0.88727 / left 0.86149 to right 1.00750 / left 0.99810; width ratios are right 0.99199 / left 0.99561. These measurements describe aperture, not likeness or certainty about photograph-derived anatomy. The complete observed model and GLB repeat exactly in two independent source builds; basis, reference, caller and all materials remain exact. The observed GLB is 7,217,076 bytes, SHA-256 `708b2ffd03829ce94fab14ce095869de09267517e8109764b866a7cd8b302eb6`.

All thirteen observed views and the fresh baseline reference comparison were directly inspected under the same directional light and camera procedure. Neutral, half-blink and full blink were independently built and captured in thirteen views each; front, right profile and clay oblique were directly inspected for each state. The opening narrows at half-blink and the lids meet at full blink in these views. Neutral closes the mouth because every expression channel is cleared; the blink documents retain the observed lip separation, so their visible enamel is not a blink-induced mouth change. Heavy orbital and lip bodies, simplified nasal volume, brown uniform skin, regular crowns and the straight striped fringe remain unlike the source. Only the aperture improvement is adopted; likeness remains **unaccepted**. Current capture directory: `.shots/human-2469/subject-eye-observation-opening/yoo-seung-ho`.

The rebuilt actual editor selects the current document from nineteen built-in choices. Observed, neutral, half-blink and blink each save exact JSON and export byte-identical GLBs against their independent source builds. Undo restores the observed document. All four editor fronts were directly inspected out of twenty-four captured views, with AMD 8060S hardware rendering and no page errors. This verifies the authored states and export path, not a natural blink trajectory or full likeness. The local editor record is `.shots/human-2469/eye-opening-built-in-yoo-seung-ho/receipt.json`; its inherited prose mentions eighteen captures, while its four state entries and six saved angles per state record twenty-four.

The following face-only observations and artifact identities are historical and do not identify the current hair-bearing aperture revision.

The source has a narrow partly open mouth with only a small tooth strip; initial replay shows a much larger, uniformly exposed upper row. Reduce current lip separation and reposition the maxillary arch while thinning the vermilion and brow mass.

Front/reference retain slightly parted lips, visible upper enamel and narrowed eyes. Both obliques and clay still show heavy lip and lid bodies, and the profile jaw remains angular. The two profiles and back confirm the actual inferred rear continuation rather than a source-observed shape. The small selected original and fringe limit superior-orbit and fine surface measurements.

[Replay document](alan-rickman.json) · [Original selection and quality](inputs.md#input-alan-rickman). Selected original: `alan-rickman_age-65_portrait.jpg`.

2026-09-16 joint-placement partial adoption: the current replay document uses upper-arch lift 1.6539542997058696 mm and recess 10.78357515534418 mm. These values couple the source-pixel incisal fit to the union of tooth/head/lip contact constraints across observed, neutral and oral-gaze states. All non-dental model parts and materials remain exact; the upper arch remains fixed across the three expressions. Final Float32 tooth versus head/lip surface checks find zero intersecting triangle pairs in all three states. This does not certify the unrepaired legacy oral backdrop or continuous motion.

All 27 candidate views and their 27 retained baseline counterparts were directly read for this person. The observed smile has a taller visible upper band and less excessive dark separation; its residual and regular crown shapes remain. The actual source-replayed legacy-cavity model changes the sampled visible-incisal mean absolute error from 8.125 to 3.50 native pixels, with 2-pixel manual reference uncertainty and 0.25-pixel sampling. This fitted-column result is not whole-face accuracy. The replacement-cavity experiments are separately retained and are not silently included in this adoption.

All three new actual-editor fronts were directly read. Saved/reloaded JSON is exact and neutral undo restores the same-browser original GLB exactly. Across all four people, eight source/browser GLBs match exactly; three Alan states and Oh observed each differ in one NORMAL Float32 component by one ULP, with every other byte exact. The new receipt records those differences without claiming cross-runtime byte identity. Hardware rendering is AMD 8060S; the editor calibration cube measures the expected 16 pixels. The open-mouth state still exposes missing lower interior and the legacy backdrop. Heavy orbital volume, simple alar form, angular face/neck planes and likeness remain unresolved. **The placement improvement is adopted; full oral anatomy and whole-face likeness are not accepted.**

The following unrestricted placement trial and older observations retain their own artifact identities and limitations.

2026-09-16 maxillary placement candidate under joint review: a one-millimetre source-builder probe establishes the rigid upper-arch translation and its derivative in the recorded photograph frame. The median signed incisal residual gives one placement candidate. The retained trial document changes only `detail.dentition.placement.lift` from 4.1 to 1.9137835445429685 mm. Crown shape, aperture, material, camera, reference and all other authored values stay exact. Every non-dental model part is unchanged in observed, neutral and oral-gaze states; the upper arch is identical across these three states.

At 4 directly read source-image columns, mean absolute visible-incisal position error changes from 8.1250 to 2.8125 native pixels. Manual photograph-reading uncertainty is 2 pixels and final Float32 triangle sampling uses a 0.25-pixel step. These are fitted-column observations, not held-out anatomical accuracy or a likeness percentage. The readings distinguish visible enamel from total crown height and lip aperture; the [tooth-display study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20111761/) supplies that observation distinction, not this person's dimensions or a cohort value to impose.

The main agent directly read all nine views of both current and candidate in all three states: 54 images for this person. Hardware rendering used AMD Radeon 8060S with an independently specified 10-mm cube (45 expected pixels, 44 measured). The observed smile shows taller upper enamel and a smaller excessive black band, closer to the photograph. The remaining unequal residual and dental gaps require individual crown/arch investigation. The initial visual pass did not identify a crossing, but the subsequent triangle census below refutes a no-intersection interpretation. Nasal planes, lid bulk, thin neck and missing lower interior remain unresolved. The fitted-column improvement remains an experiment while the shared oral-space correction continues. **Whole-face likeness and complete oral anatomy remain unaccepted.** Finite visible-surface queries and sampled views do not certify continuous collision freedom.

Subsequent joint-contact audit: actual final Float32 upper-enamel versus head/lips intersects in observed 0 to 28, neutral 0 to 32, oral-gaze 37 to 58 triangle pairs; versus the legacy oral backdrop, observed 801 to 1589, neutral 0 to 0, oral-gaze 494 to 770 pairs. These counts are intersection witnesses, not penetrated area or an anatomical severity score. Closed neutral has no oral-backdrop mesh. All four candidates expose the same deficient interior representation; improving a photographed incisal line does not resolve it. The review preserves all candidates and research, and does not claim the oral group is complete. Full interval and endpoint records are retained under `.shots/human-2469/investigation-2498/oral-state-contact` and `oral-cavity-contact`. The 12-state actual editor check reproduces every saved JSON, with four exact undo cycles. Eight GLBs match source bytes exactly; three Alan states and Oh observed each differ only by one Float32 normal component at one ULP, with all other bytes exact.

The following records retain their preceding revisions and artifact identities.

2026-09-15 aperture revision: the current document removes only the common `eye.openingScale` override of 0.84 and inherits 1.025 from its unchanged observation recipe. Projected actual lid-boundary heights, divided by the independently recorded basis heights, change from right 0.82434 / left 0.80697 to right 1.00290 / left 0.99191. Width ratios remain right 0.98251 / left 1.00400. These are geometric aperture comparisons, not a likeness score or proof that the photograph-derived basis is exact anatomy.

The observed document builds twice to identical complete models and GLBs. Materials, basis, reference and the caller remain exact. Shared attachment reconstruction also changes head and nostril tessellation, so this is not an eye-only mesh delta. Matched lip vertices move by at most 0.000397mm; differently tessellated parts are not assigned a fabricated matched-index displacement. The observed GLB is 8,429,716 bytes, SHA-256 `e6f7f1bd00124a92cc3d334774fcdcee6bff623939de845d2889fa356ece6b30`.

Fresh baseline and candidate captures use the same directional lighting and camera procedure. All thirteen candidate views were directly inspected: front, both obliques, both profiles, back, two close clay views, three full clay views and two registered reference distances. The former aperture is too compressed; removing the override improves its opening while preserving the recorded asymmetry. Neutral and bilateral blink were independently built and captured in thirteen views each; front, right profile and clay oblique were directly inspected for each state. The lips close in neutral and the lids meet in blink in these views. Deep orbital shadows, simplified nasal and oral volume, smooth young-looking tissue, brown uniform skin and striped cap-like hair remain. This is a partial aperture improvement with likeness **unaccepted**, not physiological performance certification. Current local capture directory: `.shots/human-2469/subject-alan-eye-opening/alan-rickman`.

The rebuilt editor loads this exact built-in document and preserves saved JSON, neutral, undo and bilateral blink. Three of its eighteen captures, the front of each state, were directly inspected. Strict browser/Node byte comparison fails: each state differs in one skin NORMAL Float32 component, 0.507296621799469 versus 0.5072966814041138. All other bytes, including positions, indices, UVs, materials and textures, are exact. The observed browser GLB SHA-256 is `8d5dfb3a97deb5ac437a48692c23312df588b1ce976a574e891d9af83f75a930`. Separate audit records retain this mismatch; each saved state was independently rebuilt in the browser and required byte-exact same-runtime repetition. A negative probe refuses a two-step normal change and any one-step position change. This measurement does not identify the originating arithmetic operation or claim exact cross-runtime normals. Local editor record: `.shots/human-2469/alan-opening-built-in/receipt.json`.

Earlier face-only record, retained separately from this aperture revision:

Direct source comparison: the inferred aperture and tooth exposure are too broad, creases too regular and lips too full. Narrow current lid/oral openings, lift the maxillary arch and reduce vermilion bands. Age-related fine folds and far-side skull remain unaccepted, not inferred as measured detail.

The oblique source pose, asymmetric eyelid opening and explicit chin-frame edit are preserved in the recorded build. Front/reference and clay look markedly younger than the source: wrinkles, tissue descent and individualized perioral volume are not recovered. Both obliques and profiles show simplified nasal, lip and jaw form. Back retains the common posterior lobes. One eyebrow's sparse fibres are legible in the close reference view; this is not a mature aged-skin reconstruction.

## daniel-radcliffe {#daniel-radcliffe}

[Replay document](daniel-radcliffe.json) · [Original selection and quality](inputs.md#input-daniel-radcliffe). Selected original: `daniel-radcliffe_age-13_chamber-of-secrets-premiere.jpg`.

The selected large premiere photo visibly includes lower incisors. Add their independently dimensioned mandibular row, retain the broad smile, reduce lower-lid shelf relief and regular brow mass, and narrow the lower vermilion band.

Front/reference show the broad upper row and an explicit lower dentition, but only a thin lower enamel sliver is visible in this pose. The oral gap is broad and dark, and crowns remain regular. Obliques and clay expose simplified angular nasal support and lid/brow bands. Both profiles and back retain inferred cranial/neck form. No obvious interarch protrusion was seen in these recorded views; no global dental collision certificate is implied.

## emma-watson {#emma-watson}

[Replay document](emma-watson.json) · [Original selection and quality](inputs.md#input-emma-watson). Selected original: `emma-watson_age-24_british-fashion-awards.jpg`.

The current surface-haired study adopts only a global skin-colour adjustment, from linear RGB `[0.61, 0.37, 0.29]` to `[0.9662499999999999, 0.72625, 0.6162500000000002]`. Camera, geometry, expression, roughness and review lights remain fixed. Cheeks and chin supply the fit; nose and both orbital bands are held out, and the hair-covered forehead is excluded from both groups. The directly inspected source overlay excludes eyes, brows and vermilion from the skin samples. On the 0–255 RGB scale, training-region RMS falls from 61.95 to 32.93 and held-out RMS from 44.19 to 36.90. The held-out score rises slightly during the later training improvements, so neither the numerical fit nor the selected colour is a complete facial reconstruction or a recovered physical albedo.

Two full source builds and exports agree exactly; every part and every non-skin material is unchanged, as are the observation basis and reference. The main agent inspected all thirteen new views, including front, both obliques/profiles, back, five clay frames and both registered distances. The previous dark brown cast is reduced, but pale uniform skin, heavy orbital planes, nasal form, lip volume and ribbon-like hair remain unlike the photograph. The actual AMD capture measures 44 pixels for the 45-pixel reference cube and records both resident texture samplers at 16 with no page errors. This is a partial colour improvement, not accepted likeness. Current capture directory: `.shots/human-2469/subject-skin-fixed-fit/emma-watson`; GLB `82a9a056463c8a87f9d55dc1beb2ead9a3aed3ced79ecbcdedf7a74a2c6f32b7`, 6,327,424 bytes.

The rebuilt editor's built-in Emma selection and its actual JSON/GLB downloads match that current document and independent source exactly. The separate receipt in the capture directory's `editor/` records AMD8060S, 16 expected/observed calibration pixels, nineteen subject options and no page errors. Six editor angles were captured; the main agent read front, left oblique and right profile. The colour survives the wider actual editor framing; those checks do not accept the remaining anatomy, hair or skin variation.

The following paragraphs and table retain the earlier hair-free construction review.

The original closed-mouth makeup portrait has thinner vermilion and less rigid brows than the reconstructed face. Reduce those bands and inferior-lid relief. The sharp inferred under-eye planes remain a defect requiring direct final inspection.

Front/reference keep the mouth closed and the thinner authored vermilion, but the inferior orbital surface has conspicuous triangular planes. Both obliques and clay confirm that these are visible shape defects, not merely makeup colour. Brows and nasal form remain simplified. Profiles and back show the common inferred skull and neck. Makeup and lighting in the selected source are not treated as anatomical measurements.

The source iris reads olive/hazel rather than the initial blue-grey palette. The photographed lower vermilion is thinner, the upper row is less uniform and brow fibres have softer edges. Correct the owned pigment and these profiles while retaining measured facial proportions.

Front/reference retain a narrow-eyed smile, a broad upper row and an open dark oral gap. Both obliques and clay show regular block-like crowns, strip-like brows and an angular nasal base. Profiles and back show the shared inferred skull and neck lobes. Lower-lid relief was reduced, but the observed lid shape and smiling tissue remain too generic.

The oblique original has a smaller visible tooth band, softer brows and green-hazel iris pigment. Keep hidden-side and posterior shape marked inferred; refine only the observed facial features.

The oblique reference pose retains lateral gaze and a smile, while the frontal view exposes the inferred opposite-side proportions. Obliques and clay show overly regular crowns, a broad dark oral gap and simple thin lid rolls. Profiles and back show inferred hidden anatomy and the common posterior lobes. The far side is not independently observed in the original.

2026-09-16 joint-placement partial adoption: the current replay document uses upper-arch lift 1.0325601508304607 mm and recess 7.5 mm. These values couple the source-pixel incisal fit to the union of tooth/head/lip contact constraints across observed, neutral and oral-gaze states. All non-dental model parts and materials remain exact; the upper arch remains fixed across the three expressions. Final Float32 tooth versus head/lip surface checks find zero intersecting triangle pairs in all three states. This does not certify the unrepaired legacy oral backdrop or continuous motion.

All 27 candidate views and their 27 retained baseline counterparts were directly read for this person. The formerly truncated upper crowns occupy a closer share of the photographed smile. The actual source-replayed legacy-cavity model changes the sampled visible-incisal mean absolute error from 3.10 to 0.4833 native pixels, with 1-pixel manual reference uncertainty and 0.25-pixel sampling. This fitted-column result is not whole-face accuracy. The replacement-cavity experiments are separately retained and are not silently included in this adoption.

All three new actual-editor fronts were directly read. Saved/reloaded JSON is exact and neutral undo restores the same-browser original GLB exactly. Across all four people, eight source/browser GLBs match exactly; three Alan states and Oh observed each differ in one NORMAL Float32 component by one ULP, with every other byte exact. The new receipt records those differences without claiming cross-runtime byte identity. Hardware rendering is AMD 8060S; the editor calibration cube measures the expected 16 pixels. The open-mouth state still exposes missing lower interior and the legacy backdrop. Heavy orbital volume, simple alar form, angular face/neck planes and likeness remain unresolved. **The placement improvement is adopted; full oral anatomy and whole-face likeness are not accepted.**

The following unrestricted placement trial and older observations retain their own artifact identities and limitations.

2026-09-16 maxillary placement candidate under joint review: a one-millimetre source-builder probe establishes the rigid upper-arch translation and its derivative in the recorded photograph frame. The median signed incisal residual gives one placement candidate. The retained trial document changes only `detail.dentition.placement.lift` from 5 to 1.0325601508304607 mm. Crown shape, aperture, material, camera, reference and all other authored values stay exact. Every non-dental model part is unchanged in observed, neutral and oral-gaze states; the upper arch is identical across these three states.

At 3 directly read source-image columns, mean absolute visible-incisal position error changes from 3.1000 to 0.4833 native pixels. Manual photograph-reading uncertainty is 1 pixels and final Float32 triangle sampling uses a 0.25-pixel step. These are fitted-column observations, not held-out anatomical accuracy or a likeness percentage. The readings distinguish visible enamel from total crown height and lip aperture; the [tooth-display study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20111761/) supplies that observation distinction, not this person's dimensions or a cohort value to impose.

The main agent directly read all nine views of both current and candidate in all three states: 54 images for this person. Hardware rendering used AMD Radeon 8060S with an independently specified 10-mm cube (45 expected pixels, 44 measured). Previously truncated upper crowns now occupy a visibly closer share of the photographed smile. The result improves the front, both obliques and registered reference view. Neutral appearance stays unchanged, and both profiles/open-mouth views reveal no new observed crossing. Missing lower oral anatomy, synthetic aging, lid bulk and hair silhouette remain unresolved. The fitted-column improvement remains an experiment while the shared oral-space correction continues. **Whole-face likeness and complete oral anatomy remain unaccepted.** Finite visible-surface queries and sampled views do not certify continuous collision freedom.

Subsequent joint-contact audit: actual final Float32 upper-enamel versus head/lips intersects in observed 0 to 0, neutral 0 to 0, oral-gaze 0 to 0 triangle pairs; versus the legacy oral backdrop, observed 801 to 1321, neutral 0 to 0, oral-gaze 558 to 958 pairs. These counts are intersection witnesses, not penetrated area or an anatomical severity score. Closed neutral has no oral-backdrop mesh. All four candidates expose the same deficient interior representation; improving a photographed incisal line does not resolve it. The review preserves all candidates and research, and does not claim the oral group is complete. Full interval and endpoint records are retained under `.shots/human-2469/investigation-2498/oral-state-contact` and `oral-cavity-contact`. The 12-state actual editor check reproduces every saved JSON, with four exact undo cycles. Eight GLBs match source bytes exactly; three Alan states and Oh observed each differ only by one Float32 normal component at one ULP, with all other bytes exact.

The following records retain their preceding revisions and artifact identities.

The full-body source provides few face pixels but clearly has thin lips, modest upper enamel exposure and deep orbital creases. Reduce vermilion and arch exposure; preserve the age-fold limitation and unobserved scarf-covered neck rather than claim a recovered surface.

Front/reference retain the selected open smile and lighter sparse brows, but aged tissue, wrinkles and orbital bags are insufficient: the result looks substantially younger. Both obliques and clay show uniform enamel, a regular lip band and simple alar form. Profiles and back show a generic neck and posterior skull; the original scarf prevents cervical observation. The small face within the original full-body photograph limits detail but does not excuse a likeness acceptance.

## michael-gambon {#michael-gambon}

[Replay document](michael-gambon.json) · [Original selection and quality](inputs.md#input-michael-gambon). Selected original: `michael-gambon_age-72_portrait.jpg`.

The monochrome source does not expose a white upper-tooth strip like the initial replay. Recess and lift maxillary enamel and narrow lip separation. Keep colour explicitly unobserved. The broad lower face and neck are more substantial than the initial generic continuation.

Front/reference retain narrowed eyes, slightly parted lips and the wider jaw-frame adjustment, but the face is much smoother and younger than the monochrome source. Both obliques and clay show simplified orbital and nasolabial relief; the thin visible tooth line remains regular. Profiles and back retain the common inferred rear shape. Skin and iris colours are authored, unobserved values because the source is monochrome.

2026-09-16 optical partial adoption: the current document sets `sphereFit: observation-ray`, `opticalFrame: radial`, `canthalSupport: tangent` and `surfaceRadius: 12`. All other authored values, source identity and observed expression remain exact. Two independent complete builds reproduce the retained candidate's model and GLB exactly. The spherical radius is an authored approximation at human-eye scale, not person-specific biometry. [Adult CT measurements](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4238270/) describe varying, unequal axes; [juvenile longitudinal biometry](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23575156/) measures axial growth. Neither establishes a universal 12-mm spherical radius or a radius recoverable from this photograph. The fixed-canthus hull is geometric support, not a measured conjunctival surface.

All nine views in each of observed, bilateral blink and oral-gaze were directly inspected: 27 views for this person, under AMD hardware rendering with an independently specified 10-mm calibration cube (45 expected pixels, 44 measured). The visible right optical aperture gains curved reflection and the canthal transition avoids the preceding depth-only trial's deep pit. The asymmetric observed squint remains. Excess superior hood, narrow neck, angular nasal base and insufficient aged tissue persist. Both profiles and back retain the cap-like white groom and patterned shadows. The oral-gaze diagnostic hides the previously visible dental row; this is an unresolved oral-state issue, not evidence of an optical repair. In full blink the optical apertures are covered; that sampled closure does not validate natural blink motion. The optical improvement is adopted while the coupled tissue work continues; **whole-face likeness remains unaccepted**.

The following entries preserve preceding revisions and their own artifact identities; their use of “current” refers to those earlier checkpoints.

2026-09-15 layered-hair partial adoption: retain the colour/brow document below and replace only its hair profiles and resident hair finishes with independently authored inner and outer layers (1,024 and 640 cards). Every non-hair part and its material, the source basis/reference, neck and expression remain exact. The other eighteen working documents are byte-identical. Two complete source builds reproduce the same model and 12,007,388-byte GLB. These numerical cards use procedural textures, not pixels from the source photograph.

The main agent directly inspected all thirteen new views: front, both obliques, both profiles, back, close clay, close clay-oblique, full clay, full clay-oblique, full clay-profile and two registered reference distances. Fine white coverage replaces the broad grey coils at both distances, and the side/back no longer read as rows of thick ribbons. The silhouette is still a uniform cap rather than the source's irregular curl masses; the fringe, hairline and strong patterned forehead shadows remain wrong. Facial planes, skin variation, aged tissue, oral contents and cervical proportions are unresolved. This is a partial improvement, not accepted likeness. The AMD GPU capture measures 44 pixels for a 45-pixel calibration span and records all four resident texture samplers at anisotropy 16, with no page errors.

Current layered identities: document `61de229a4f2b347e17e06bd44defaa449a995456f4830fec30ff96e724ff06d2`; model JSON `76691a7a5ad6901b99d6d5899a9fad6b2c43a281c8648391294c5e5eb1f0b3dd`; GLB `011bc040e9fdfd48d97583e4e2992c46132fb2eed6c99e0f2a6a440df68a1da7`. Current capture directory: `.shots/human-2469/subject-hair-layered-current-face/miriam-margolyes`. The gallery selects this revision and its downloadable document matches the tracked study.

The rebuilt editor's new built-in selection, neutral button, undo and bilateral-blink import were verified separately for these layers. All three saved documents and GLBs match independent source output exactly. The AMD GPU receipt at `.shots/human-2469/miriam-layered-built-in/receipt.json` records 16 expected/observed calibration pixels, nineteen subject options and no page errors. Eighteen editor views were captured; the main agent directly read the observed, neutral and blink fronts. The fine white coverage survives the editor's wider framing and mouth/eye closure works, while the cap-like hair, eye folds and synthetic skin persist. Resetting expression channels is not a reconstruction of the person's physiological neutral face.

Earlier colour/brow revision:

2026-09-15 partial colour and superior-orbit update: change only the skin's linear RGB from [0.51, 0.28, 0.215] to [0.64875, 0.2875, 0.2375] and the detailed brow-foundation projection from -1 to -3 mm. Source observations, basis, expression, hair, neck and every other authored material/profile remain unchanged. Two full-source builds reproduce the same model and 12,080,884-byte GLB. This is an authored colour under fixed review lighting, not recovered physical albedo or accepted likeness.

The initial orbital measurement accidentally included the photographed fringe. Reassessment restricts the two orbital regions to the skin between the brow and upper lid and a band below the lower lid, with 104/119 sampled locations. The hair-covered forehead is excluded from the summary. Across six equally weighted skin regions, image RGB RMS decreases from 34.96 to 32.50 after colour alone and 30.67 after the additional brow change; orbital RMS decreases from 38.46 to 34.73 to 29.29. A -5 mm brow trial and nasal-depth reductions did not improve those respective comparisons and were not selected. These fixed-light pixel differences are not identity scores.

The main agent directly inspected all ten current captures: front, both obliques, both profiles, back, clay, clay-oblique, reference-close and reference. Front/reference show warmer skin and less recessed-looking upper-lid illumination. Both obliques and clay still expose an artificial lid shelf, angular nasal base and insufficient aged tissue; the large oral opening still lacks the photographed interior form. Profiles/back retain the inferred narrow submental transition and broad coiled hair strips. Nose and cervical-depth trials remain separate, unadopted studies. Likeness remains **unaccepted**.

Earlier capture directory: `.shots/human-2469/subject-face-brow3/miriam-margolyes`.

The rebuilt editor's built-in subject selection loads this exact tracked document. Its observed, zero-channel neutral and bilateral-blink JSON/GLB exports match independent source outputs, with exact undo back to the observed document. The actual AMD GPU receipt at `.shots/human-2469/miriam-built-in/receipt.json` records 16 expected/observed calibration pixels and no page errors. Eighteen editor views were captured; the main agent directly read the three front views. Neutral closes the mouth and blink covers the optical apertures, but both retain synthetic lid folds and coiled strips. Channel reset is not an observed physiological neutral reconstruction. The following face-only observations and identities are historical.

The large source shows both dental arches, a broad cervical connection and a deeply expressive tilted face. Add an independent lower arch and widen the neck; keep the established left-cheek safety profile. The unmodeled tongue and detailed age folds remain explicit likeness defects.

Front/reference retain the strongly open smile and asymmetric squint. The explicit lower dentition appears only as small edge slivers; the large empty oral space lacks the photographed tongue and complex inner-mouth form. Both obliques and clay expose angular medial orbital transitions and insufficient aged cheek/perioral tissue. Profiles and back show generic inferred hidden anatomy. The age and expression likeness are unaccepted; the secondary background person was not used as the target.

## rupert-grint {#rupert-grint}

[Replay document](rupert-grint.json) · [Original selection and quality](inputs.md#input-rupert-grint). Selected original: `rupert-grint_age-14_chamber-of-secrets-premiere.jpg`.

The premiere photograph has light ginger brows and a thin, irregular closed smile. Reduce the initial broad vermilion band and brow fibre mass while retaining eye opening and the observed facial asymmetry; skin freckles remain unsupported.

The front/reference mouth is closed, with a thin constructed vermilion band. Obliques and clay show regular lid shelves, a simplified tip/alar base and weak individualized soft tissue. Profiles and back retain inferred jaw depth and the generic cranial/neck lobes. The source-pose arrangement is present but is not a likeness acceptance.
